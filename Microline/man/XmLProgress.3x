.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <XmL/Progress.h>
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
A progress bar which can be used to chart completion of a task.
Along with a Progress meter, this widget may optionally display text with
percentage completion and elapsed and estimated time to completion. 
.SS Class Information
Progress inherits from XmPrimitive and Core. Its class pointer
is xmlProgressWidgetClass.  Its class name is XmLProgress.

.IP XmNcompleteValue
Defines the maximum value of the XmNvalue resource. When
the XmNvalue resource reaches this number, the Progress bar
will show 100% complete. This value is used to determine the 
percentage to complete and to estimate time to completion.
.IP XmNfontList
The font list used for drawing the percentage complete and estimated time.
.IP XmNmeterStyle
The style of the meter to draw. Possible values:

.nf
     XmMETER_BAR     /* standard bar meter */
     XmMETER_BOXES   /* shadowed boxes meter */
.fi

Only the XmMETER_BAR style can display the percentage complete
indicator and optional and estimated time to completion.
.IP XmNnumBoxes
When XmNmeterStyle is XmMETER_BOXES, this resource defines
the number of boxes to display in the meter.
.IP XmNshowPercentage
If set to True, text will be shown centered in the widget
displaying the current percentage complete. The percentage
complete is calculated by dividing the XmNvalue by the XmNcompleteValue.
.IP XmNshowTime
If set to True, the widget will display the elapsed time in the
left of the widget and the estimated time remaining on the right.
The estimated time remaining is calculated using the XmNvalue, 
the XmNcompleteValue and the start time. The start time is the
last time the XmNvalue was set to 0. No estimated time is shown
when XmNvalue is 0 or when it is equal to the XmNcompleteValue.
If set to False, only a percentage complete indicator will be shown.
.IP XmNvalue
A value from 0 to the XmNcompleteValue which defines how much
progress has taken place. When this value is set to 0, the current
time is stored as the start time for calculating estimated 
time to completion.
