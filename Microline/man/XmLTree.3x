.SH NAME
XmLTree
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <XmL/Tree.h>
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
A Tree is a subclass of the Grid widget which displays a hierarchical
tree with a Pixmap, XmString, connecting lines and
possibly an expand/collapse graphic in the cells of its first column.
Each row in the Tree has a position and level which is 
used to determine its relationship to other rows in the Tree.  Rows
may be expanded or collapsed by clicking on an expand/collapse graphic
or by activating a row with the keyboard.  The Tree inherits
all the abilities of the Grid widget, allowing it to contain
multiple columns and rows of varying types, heading and fixed rows and
columns, interactive row and column resizing, cell borders, etc.
.SS Class Information
Tree inherits from XmLGrid, XmManager, Constraint, Composite and Core.
Its class pointer is xmlTreeWidgetClass.  Its class name is XmLTree.
.SS New Resources
The Tree resources defined below affect its overall layout and
appearance.  Definitions of resources affecting rows, columns
and cells follow the Tree resource definitions.

.fi
.IP XmNconnectingLineColor
The color of the line which is drawn connecting parents, children
and siblings in the first column of the Tree.  This values defaults
to the foreground color of the Tree.
.IP XmNlevelSpacing
The indent in pixels for each level in the Tree.
.IP XmNplusMinusColor
The color of the plus and minus expand/collapse graphics drawn
next to parent nodes which may be expanded.  This value defaults
to the foreground color of the Tree.
.SS Row/Column/Cell Resources
Tree defines the resources in the table below affecting rows.  In addition
to these row resources, the Tree inherits all the row, column and cell
resources which exist in the Grid.

 int                       0                     SG
.fi
.IP XmNrowExpands
True if the row may expand (it is a parent) and False otherwise.
.IP XmNrowIsExpanded
True if the row is currently expanded and False otherwise.  If this
resource is set to False, the Tree will hide all children of this
row.  Children of this row are determined to be all rows which are
of a level greater than this row's until we find the next row
which is of this row's level or less (a sibling or parent of this
row).  Rows are hidden by setting their XmNrowHeight to 0.  If
this resource is set to True, the Tree will show all children of
this row.  Rows are shown by setting their XmNrowHeight to 1.
The value of this resource has no meaning if XmNrowExpands is False.
.IP XmNrowLevel
The level of the row in the Tree.
.SS Callback Resources
Tree defines the following callback resources.

.ft P
XmNcollapseCallback    XmCR_COLLAPSE_ROW     Row is collapsed by activate
                                             or by clicking on collapse
                                             graphic
XmNexpandCallback      XmCR_EXPAND_ROW       Row is expanded by activate
                                             or by clicking on expand
                                             graphic

.SS Callback Structure
Each callback function is passed a pointer to a XmLGridCallbackStruct
structure. See the XmLGrid's Callback Structure section for the
full structure definition.

The following table shows which values are set for which callback
reasons.  Elements not set will have undefined values.
