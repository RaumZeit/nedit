"Welcome to NEdit!\n\
\n\
NEdit is a standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) style text editor for \
programs and plain-text files.  Users of Macintosh and MS Windows based \
text editors should find NEdit a familiar and comfortable environment.  \
NEdit provides all of the standard menu, dialog, editing, and mouse \
support, as well as all of the standard shortcuts to which the users \
of modern GUI based environments are accustomed.  For users of older \
style Unix editors, welcome to the world of mouse-based editing!\n\
\n\
Help sections of interest to new users are listed under the \"Basic \
Operation\" heading in the top-level Help menu:\n\
\n\
	Selecting Text\n\
	Finding and Replacing Text\n\
	Cut and Paste\n\
	Using the Mouse\n\
	Keyboard Shortcuts\n\
	Shifting and Filling\n\
\n\
Programmers should also read the introductory section under the \
\"Features for Programming\" section:\n\
\n\
	Programming with NEdit\n\
\n\
If you get into trouble, the Undo command in the Edit menu can reverse \
any modifications that you make.  NEdit does not change the file you are \
editing until you tell it to Save.\n\
\n\
Editing an Existing File\n\
\n\
To open an existing file, choose Open... from the file menu. Select the \
file that you want to open in the pop-up dialog that appears and click on \
OK.  You may open any number of files at the same time.  Each file will \
appear in its own editor window.  Using Open... rather than re-typing the \
NEdit command and running additional copies of NEdit, will give you quick \
access to all of the files you have open via the Windows menu, and ensure \
that you don't accidentally open the same file twice.  NEdit has no \
\"main\" window.  It remains running as long as at least one editor window \
is open.\n\
\n\
Creating a New File\n\
\n\
If you already have an empty (Untitled) window displayed, just begin \
typing in the window.  To create a new Untitled window, choose New from \
the File menu.  To give the file a name and save its contents to the \
disk, choose Save or Save As... from the File menu.\n\
\n\
Backup Files\n\
\n\
NEdit maintains periodic backups of the file you are editing so that you \
can recover the file in the event of a problem such as a system crash, \
network failure, or X server crash.  These files are saved under the name \
~filename (on Unix) or _filename (on VMS), where filename is the name of \
the file you were editing.  If an NEdit process is killed, some of these \
backup files may remain in your directory.  (To remove one of these files \
on Unix, you may have to prefix the ~ (tilde) character with a \
(backslash) to prevent the shell from interpreting it as a special \
character.)\n\
\n\
Shortcuts\n\
\n\
As you become more familiar with NEdit, substitute the control and \
function keys shown on the right side of the menus for pulling down menus \
with the mouse.\n\
\n\
Dialogs are also streamlined so you can enter information quickly and \
without using the mouse*.  To move the keyboard focus around a dialog, \
use the tab and arrow keys.  One of the buttons in a dialog is usually \
drawn with a thick, indented, outline.  This button can be activated by \
pressing return or enter.  The Cancel or Dismiss button can be activated \
by pressing escape.  For example, to replace the string \"thing\" with \
\"things\" type:\n\
\n\
    <ctrl-r>thing<tab>things<return>\n\
\n\
To open a file named \"whole_earth.c\", type:\n\
\n\
    <ctrl-o>who<return>\n\
\n\
(how much of the filename you need to type depends on the other files in \
the directory).  See the section called Keyboard Shortcuts for more \
details.\n\
\n\
* Users who have set their keyboard focus mode to \"pointer\" should set \
\"Popups Under Pointer\" in the Default Settings menu to avoid the \
additional step of moving the mouse into the dialog.",

"The Search menu contains a number of commands for finding and replacing text.\n\
\n\
The Find... and Replace... commands present dialogs for entering text for \
searching and replacing.  These dialogs also allow you to choose whether you \
want the search to be sensitive to upper and lower case, or whether to use the \
standard Unix pattern matching characters (regular expressions).  Searches \
begin at the current text insertion position.\n\
\n\
Find Again and Replace Again repeat the last find or replace command without \
prompting for search strings.  To selectively replace text, use the two \
commands in combination: Find Again, then Replace Again if \
the highlighted string should be replaced, or Find Again again to go to the \
next string.\n\
\n\
Find Selection searches for the text contained in the current primary \
selection (see Selecting Text).  The selected text does not have to \
be in the current editor window, it may even be in another program.  For \
example, if the word dog appears somewhere in a window on your screen, and \
you want to find it in the file you are editing, select the \
word dog by dragging the mouse across it, switch to your NEdit window and \
choose Find Selection from the Search menu.\n\
\n\
Searching Backwards\n\
\n\
Holding down the shift key while choosing any of the search or replace \
commands from the menu (or using the keyboard shortcut), will search in \
the reverse direction.  Users who have set the search direction using \
the buttons in the search dialog, may find it a bit confusing that Find \
Again and Replace Again don't continue in the same direction as the \
original search (for experienced users, consistency \
of the direction implied by the shift key is more important).\n\
\n\
Selective Replacement\n\
\n\
To replace only some occurrences of a string within a file, choose Replace... \
from the Search menu, enter the string to search for and the string to \
substitute, and finish by pressing the Find button.  When the first \
occurrence is highlighted, use either Replace Again (^T) to replace it, or \
Find Again (^G) to move to the next occurrence without replacing it, and \
continue in such a manner through all occurrences of interest.\n\
\n\
To replace all occurrences of a string within some range of text, \
select the range (see Selecting Text), choose Replace... from the \
Search menu, type the string to search for and the string to substitute, and \
press the \"R. in Selection\" button in the dialog.  Note that selecting text \
in the Replace... dialog will unselect the text in the window.",

"NEdit \
has two general types of selections, primary (highlighted text), and \
secondary (underlined text). Selections can cover either \
a simple range of text between two points in the file, or they can \
cover a rectangular area of the file.  Rectangular selections \
are only useful with non-proportional (fixed spacing) fonts.\n\
\n\
To select text for copying, deleting, or replacing, press the left \
mouse button with the pointer at one end of the text you want to select, \
and drag it to the other end.  The text will become highlighted.  To \
select a whole word, double click (click twice quickly in succession).  \
Double clicking and then dragging the mouse will select a number of words.  \
Similarly, you can select \
a whole line or a number of lines by triple clicking or triple clicking and \
dragging.  Quadruple clicking selects the whole file.  \
After releasing the mouse button, you can still adjust a selection \
by holding down the shift key and dragging on either end of the selection.  \
To delete the selected text, press delete or backspace.  To replace it, \
begin typing.\n\
\n\
To select a rectangle or column of text, hold the Ctrl key while dragging \
the mouse.  Rectangular selections can be used in any context that \
normal selections can be used, including cutting and pasting, filling, \
shifting, dragging, and searching.  Operations on rectangular selections \
automatically fill in tabs and spaces to maintain alignment of text \
within and to the right of the selection.  Note that the interpretation \
of rectangular selections by Fill Paragraph is slightly different from that \
of other commands, the section titled \"Shifting and Filling\" has details.\n\
\n\
The middle mouse button can be used to make an \
additional selection (called the secondary selection).  As soon as the \
button is released, the contents of this selection will be \
copied to the insert position of the window where the mouse was last \
clicked (the destination window).  This position is marked by a caret \
shaped cursor when the \
mouse is outside of the destination window.  \
If there is a (primary) selection, adjacent to the cursor \
in the window, \
the new text will replace the selected text.  Holding the shift key \
while making the secondary selection will move the text, deleting it \
at the site of the secondary selection, rather than \
copying it.\n\
\n\
Selected text can also be dragged to a new location in the file using the \
middle mouse button.  Holding the shift key while \
dragging the text will copy the selected text, leaving the original \
text in place.  Holding the control key will drag the text in overlay \
mode.\n\
\n\
Normally, dragging moves text by removing it from the \
selected position at the start of the drag, and inserting it at a \
new position relative to to the mouse.  Dragging a block of text \
over existing characters, displaces the characters to \
the end of the selection.  In overlay mode, characters which are \
occluded by blocks of text being dragged are simply removed.  When \
dragging non-rectangular selections, overlay mode also converts the \
selection to rectangular form, allowing it to be dragged outside of \
the bounds of the existing text.\n\
\n\
The section \"Using the Mouse\" sumarizes the mouse commands for making \
primary and secondary selections.  Primary selections can also be made \
via keyboard commands, see \"Keyboard Shortcuts\".",

"The easiest way to copy and move text around in your file or between \
windows, is to use the clipboard, an imaginary area that temporarily stores \
text and data.  The Cut command removes the \
selected text (see Selecting Text) from your file and places it in the \
clipboard.  Once text is in \
the clipboard, the Paste command will copy it to the insert position in the \
current window.  For example, to move some text from one place to another, \
select it by \
dragging the mouse over it, choose Cut to remove it, \
click the pointer to move the insert point where you want the text inserted, \
then choose Paste to insert it.  Copy copies text to the clipboard without \
deleting it from your file.  You can also use the clipboard to transfer text \
to and from other Motif programs and X programs which make proper use of \
the clipboard.\n\
\n\
There are many other methods for copying and moving text within \
NEdit windows and between NEdit and other programs.  The most common \
such method is clicking the middle mouse button to copy the primary \
selection (to the clicked position).  Copying the selection by clicking \
the middle mouse button in many cases is the only way to transfer data \
to and from many X programs.  Holding the Shift key while clicking the \
middle mouse button moves the text, deleting it from its original \
position, rather than copying it.  Other methods for transferring text \
include secondary selections, primary selection dragging, keyboard-based \
selection copying, and drag and drop.  These are described in detail in \
the sections: Selecting Text, Using the Mouse, and Keyboard Shortcuts.",


"Programmers who use structured languages usually require some form of \
automatic indent, so that they don't have to continually re-type the \
sequences of tabs and/or spaces needed to maintain lengthy running indents.  \
Version 5.0 of NEdit is the first release of NEdit to offer \"smart\" \
indent, at least experimentally, in addition to the traditional automatic \
indent which simply lines up the cursor position with the previous line.\n\
\n\
Smart Indent\n\
\n\
Smart Indent in this release must still be considered somewhat \
experimental.  Smart indent macros are only available by default for C \
and C++, and while these can easily be configured for different default \
indentation distances, they may not conform to everyone's exact C \
programming style.  Smart indent is programmed in terms of macros in the \
NEdit macro language which can be entered in: Preferences -> Default \
Settings -> Indent -> Program Smart Indent.  Hooks are provided for \
intervening at the point that a newline is entered, either via the user \
pressing the Enter key, or through auto-wrapping; and for arbitrary \
type-in to act on specific characters typed.\n\
\n\
To type a newline character without invoking smart-indent when operating \
in smart-indent mode, hold the Ctrl key while pressing the Return or \
Enter key.\n\
\n\
Auto-Indent\n\
\n\
With Indent set to Auto (the default), NEdit keeps a running indent.  \
When you press the Return or Enter key, \
spaces and tabs are inserted to line up the insert point under the start of \
the previous line.  Ctrl+Return in auto-indent mode acts like a normal \
return, With auto-indent turned off, Ctrl+Return does indentation.\n\
\n\
Block Indentation Adjustment\n\
\n\
The Shift Left and Shift Right commands as well as rectangular dragging \
can be used to adjust the \
indentation for several lines at once.  To shift a block of text one \
character \
to the right, select the text, then choose Shift Right from the Edit menu.  \
Note that the accelerator keys for these menu items are Ctrl+9 and Ctrl+0, \
which correspond to  the right and left parenthesis on most keyboards.  \
Remember them as adjusting the text in the direction pointed to by the \
parenthesis character.  Holding the Shift key while selecting either \
Shift Left or Shift Right will shift the text by one tab stop (or by one \
emulated tab stop if tab emulation is turned on).  The help section \
\"Shifting and Filling\" under \"Basic Operation\" has details.",


"Changing the Tab Distance\n\
\n\
Tabs are important for programming in languages which use indentation \
to show nesting, as short-hand for producing white-space for leading \
indents.  As a programmer, you have to decide how to use indentation, \
and how or whether tab characters map to your indentation scheme.\n\
\n\
Ideally, tab characters map directly to the amount of indent that you \
use to distinguish nesting levels in your code.  Unfortunately, the \
Unix standard for interpretation of tab characters is eight characters \
(probably dating back to mechanical capabilities of the original \
teletype), which is usually too coarse for a single indent.\n\
\n\
Most text editors, NEdit included, allow you to change the \
interpretation of the tab character, and many programmers take \
advantage of this, and set their tabs to 3 or 4 characters to match \
their programming style.  In NEdit you set the hardware tab distance in \
Preferences -> Tabs... for the current window, or Preferences -> \
Default Settings -> Tabs... (general), or Preferences -> Default \
Settings -> Language Modes... (language-specific) to change the \
defaults for future windows.\n\
\n\
Changing the meaning of the tab character makes programming much easier \
while you're in the editor, but can cause you headaches outside of the \
editor, because there is no way to pass along the tab setting as part \
of a plain-text file.  All of the other tools which display, print, and \
otherwise process your source code have to be made aware of how the \
tabs are set, and must be able to handle the change.  Non-standard tabs \
can also confuse other programmers, or make editing your code difficult \
for them if their text editors don't support changes in tab distance.\n\
\n\
Emulated Tabs\n\
\n\
An alternative to changing the interpretation of the tab character is \
tab emulation.  In the Tabs... dialog(s), turning on Emulated Tabs \
causes the Tab key to insert the correct number of spaces and/or tabs \
to bring the cursor the next emulated tab stop, as if tabs were set at \
the emulated tab distance rather than the hardware tab distance. \
Backspacing immediately after entering an emulated tab will delete the \
fictitious tab as a unit, but as soon as you move the cursor away from \
the spot, NEdit will forget that the collection of spaces and tabs is a \
tab, and will treat it as separate characters.  To enter a real tab \
character with \"Emulate Tabs\" turned on, use Ctrl+Tab.\n\
\n\
It is also possible to tell NEdit not to insert ANY tab characters at \
all in the course of processing emulated tabs, and in shifting and \
rectangular insertion/deletion operations, for programmers who worry \
about the misinterpretation of tab characters on other systems.",

"Though general in appearance, NEdit has many \
features intended specifically for programmers.  Major \
programming-related topics are listed in separate sections under the heading: \
\"Features for Programming\": Syntax Highlighting, \
Tabs and Tab Emulation, ctags support, and Automatic Indent.  Minor topics \
related to programming are discussed below:\n\
\n\
Language Modes\n\
\n\
When nedit initially reads a file, it attempts to determine whether the \
file is in one of the computer languages that it knows about.  Knowing \
what language a file is written in allows NEdit to assign highlight \
patterns and smart indent macros, and to set language specific \
preferences like word delimiters, tab emulation, and auto-indent.  \
Language mode can be recognized from both the file name and from the \
first 200 characters of content.  Language mode recognition and \
language-specific preferences are configured \
in: Preferences -> Default Settings -> Language Modes....\n\
\n\
You can set the language mode manually for a window, by selecting \
it from the menu: Preferences -> Language Modes.\n\
\n\
Line Numbers\n\
\n\
To find a particular line in a source file by line number, choose Goto \
Line #... from the Search menu.  You can also directly select the line \
number text in the compiler message in the terminal emulator window \
(xterm, decterm, winterm, etc.) where you ran the compiler, and choose \
Goto Selected from the Search menu.\n\
\n\
To find out the line number of a particular line in your file, turn on \
Statistics Line in the Preferences menu and position the insertion point \
anywhere on the line.  The statistics line continuously updates the line \
number of the line containing the cursor.\n\
\n\
Matching Parentheses\n\
\n\
To help you inspect nested parentheses, brackets, braces, quotes, and other \
characters, NEdit has both an automatic parenthesis matching mode, and a \
Find Matching command.  Automatic parenthesis matching is activated when \
you type, or move the insertion cursor after a parenthesis, bracket, or \
brace.  It momentarily highlights the matching character if that character \
is visible in the window.  To find a matching character anywhere in \
the file, select it or position the cursor after it, and choose Find \
Matching from the Search menu.  If \
the character matches itself, such as a quote or slash, select the first \
character of the pair.  NEdit will match {, (, [, <, \", \', `, /, and \\.\n\
\n\
Opening Included Files\n\
\n\
The Open Selected command in the File menu understands the C \
preprocessor's #include \
syntax, so selecting an #include line and invoking Open Selected will \
generally find the file referred to, unless doing so depends on the \
settings of compiler switches or other information not available to NEdit.\n\
\n\
Interface to Programming Tools\n\
\n\
Integrated software development environments such as SGI's CaseVision and \
Centerline Software's Code Center, can be interfaced \
directly with NEdit via the client server interface.  These \
tools allow you to click directly on compiler and runtime error messages \
and request NEdit to open files, and select lines of interest.  \
The easiest method is usually to use \
the tool's interface for character-based editors like vi, to invoke nc, \
but programatic interfaces can also be derived using the source code \
for nc.\n\
\n\
There are also some simple compile/review, grep, ctree, and ctags browsers \
available in the NEdit contrib directory on ftp.fnal.gov.",

"NEdit can process tags files generated using the Unix ctags command.  \
Ctags creates index files correlating names of functions and declarations \
with their locations in C, Fortran, or Pascal source code files. (See the \
ctags manual page for more information).  Ctags produces a file called \
\"tags\" which can be loaded by NEdit.  Once loaded, the information in \
the tags file enables NEdit to go directly to the declaration of a \
highlighted function or data structure name with a single command.  To \
load a tags file, select \"Load Tags File\" from the File menu and choose \
a tags file to load, or specify the name of the tags file on the NEdit \
command line:\n\
\n\
    nedit -tags tags\n\
\n\
NEdit can also be set to load a tags file automatically when it starts up.  \
Setting the X resource nedit.tagFile to the name of a tag file tells NEdit \
to look for that file at startup time (see Customizing NEdit).  The file name \
can be either a complete path name, in which case NEdit will always load \
the same tags file, or a file name without a path or with a relative path, \
in which case NEdit will load it starting from the current directory.  The \
second option allows you to have different tags files for different \
projects, each automatically loaded depending on the directory you're in \
when you start NEdit.  Setting the name to \"tags\" is an obvious choice \
since this is the name that ctags uses.\n\
\n\
To find the definition of a function or data structure once a tags file is \
loaded, select the name anywhere it appears in your program (see Selecting \
Text) and choose \"Find Definition\" from the Search menu.",

"Mouse-based \
editing is what NEdit is all about, and learning to use the more advanced \
features like secondary selections and primary selection \
dragging will be well worth your while.\n\
\n\
If you don't have time to learn everything, you can get by adequately with \
just the left mouse button:  Clicking the left button \
moves the cursor.  \
Dragging with the left button makes a selection.  Holding the shift \
key while clicking extends the existing selection, or begins a selection \
between the cursor and the mouse.  Double or triple clicking selects a \
whole word or a whole line.\n\
\n\
This section will make more sense if you also read the section called, \
\"Selecting Text\", which explains the terminology of selections, i.e. \
what is meant by primary, secondary, rectangular, etc.\n\

The middle mouse button is for making secondary selections, and copying and \
dragging the primary selection\n\
\n\
  Click        Copies the primary selection to the\n\
 	       clicked position.\n\
\n\
  Shift+Click  Moves the primary selection to the\n\
 	       clicked position, deleting it from its\n\
 	       original position.\n\
\n\
  Drag	       1) Outside of the primary selection:\n\
 	           Begins a secondary selection.\n\
 	       2) Inside of the primary selection:\n\
 	           Moves the selection by dragging.\n\
\n\
  Ctrl+Drag    1) Outside of the primary selection:\n\
 	           Begins a rectangular secondary\n\
 	           selection.\n\
 	       2) Inside of the primary selection:\n\
 	           Drags the selection in overlay\n\
 	           mode (see below).\n\
\n\
When the mouse button is released after creating a secondary selection:\n\
\n\
  No Modifiers	If there is a primary selection,\n\
 		replaces it with the secondary\n\
 		selection.  Otherwise, inserts the\n\
 		secondary selection at the cursor\n\
 		position.\n\
\n\
  Shift 	Move the secondary selection, deleting\n\
 		it from its original position.  If\n\
 		there is a primary selection, the move\n\
 		will replace the primary selection\n\
 		with the secondary selection.\n\
 		Otherwise, moves the secondary\n\
 		selection to to the cursor position.\n\
\n\
  Alt*		Exchange the primary and secondary\n\
 		selections.\n\
\n\
\n\
While moving the primary selection by dragging with the middle mouse button:\n\
\n\
  Shift   Leaves a copy of the original\n\
 	  selection in place rather than\n\
 	  removing it or blanking the area.\n\
 \n\
  Ctrl	  Changes from insert mode to overlay\n\
 	  mode (see below).\n\
\n\
  Escape  Cancels drag in progress.\n\
\n\
Overlay Mode: Normally, dragging moves text by removing it from the \
selected position at the start of the drag, and inserting it at a \
new position relative to to the mouse. When you drag a block of text \
over existing characters, the existing characters are displaced to \
the end of the selection.  In overlay mode, characters which are \
occluded by blocks of text being dragged are simply removed.  When \
dragging non-rectangular selections, overlay mode also converts the \
selection to rectangular form, allowing it to be dragged outside of \
the bounds of the existing text.\n\
\n\
\n\
* The Alt key may be labeled Meta or Compose-Character on some \
keyboards.  Some window managers, including default configurations \
of mwm, bind combinations of the Alt key and mouse buttons to window \
manager operations.  In NEdit, Alt is only used on button release, \
so regardless of the window manager bindings for Alt-modified mouse \
buttons, you can still do the corresponding NEdit operation by using \
the Alt key AFTER the initial mouse press, so that Alt is held while \
you release the mouse button.  If you find this difficult or \
annoying, you can re-configure most window managers to skip this \
binding, or you can re-configure NEdit to use a different key \
combination.",

"Most of the keyboard shortcuts in NEdit are shown on the right hand sides \
of the pull-down menus.  However, there are more which are not as obvious.  \
These include; dialog button shortcuts; menu and \
dialog mnemonics; labeled keyboard keys, such as the arrows, page-up, \
page-down, and home; and optional Shift modifiers on accelerator keys, like \
[Shift]Ctrl+F.\n\
\n\
\n\
Menu Accelerators\n\
\n\
Pressing the key combinations shown on the right of the menu items is a \
shortcut for selecting the menu item with the mouse.  Some items have the \
shift key enclosed in brackets, such as [Shift]Ctrl+F.  This indicates \
that the shift key is optional.  In search commands, including the shift \
key reverses the direction of the search.  In Shift commands, it makes the \
command shift the selected text by a whole tab stop rather than by \
single characters.\n\
\n\
\n\
Menu Mnemonics\n\
\n\
Pressing the Alt key in combination with one of the underlined characters \
in the menu bar pulls down that menu.  Once the menu is pulled down, \
typing the underlined characters in a menu item (without the Alt key) \
activates that item.  With a menu pulled down, you can also use the arrow \
keys to select menu items, and the space or enter keys to activate them.\n\
\n\
\n\
Keyboard Shortcuts within Dialogs\n\
\n\
One button in a dialog is usually marked with a thick indented outline.  \
Pressing the Return or Enter key activates this button.\n\
\n\
All dialogs have either a Cancel or Dismiss button.  This button can \
be activated by pressing the Escape (or Esc) key.\n\
\n\
Pressing the tab key moves the keyboard focus to the next item in a \
dialog.  Within an associated group of buttons, the arrow keys move \
the focus among the buttons.  Shift+Tab moves backward through the items.\n\
\n\
Most items in dialogs have an underline under one character in their name.  \
Pressing the Alt key along with this character, activates a button as if you \
had pressed it with the mouse, or moves the keyboard focus to the associated \
text field or list.\n\
\n\
You can select items from a list by using the arrow keys to move the \
selection and space to select.\n\
\n\
In file selection dialogs, you can type the beginning characters of the \
file name or directory in the list to select files\n\
\n\
\n\
Labeled Function Keys \n\
\n\
The labeled function keys on standard workstation and PC keyboards, like \
the arrows, and page-up and page-down, are active in NEdit, though not \
shown in the pull-down menus.\n\
\n\
Holding down the control key while pressing a named key extends the \
scope of the action that it performs.  For example, Home normally moves \
the insert cursor the beginning of a line.  Ctrl+Home moves it to the \
beginning of the file. Backspace deletes one character, Ctrl+Backspace \
deletes one word.\n\
\n\
Holding down the shift key while pressing a named key begins or extends \
a selection.  Combining the shift and control keys combines their \
actions.  For example, to select a word without using the mouse, \
position the cursor at the beginning of the word and press \
Ctrl+Shift+RightArrow.  The Alt key modifies selection commands to make \
the selection rectangular.\n\
\n\
Under X and Motif, there are several levels of translation between \
keyboard keys and the actions they perform in a program.  The \
\"Customizing NEdit\", and \"X Resources\" sections of the Help \
menu have more information on this subject.  Because of all of this \
configurability, and since keyboards and standards for the meaning of \
some keys vary from machine to machine, the mappings may be changed from \
the defaults listed below.\n\
\n\
Modifier Keys (in general)\n\
\n\
  Ctrl	 Extends the scope of the action that the key\n\
 	 would otherwise perform.  For example, Home\n\
 	 normally moves the insert cursor the beginning of\n\
 	 a line. Ctrl+Home moves it to the beginning of\n\
 	 the file.  Backspace deletes one character, Ctrl+\n\
 	 Backspace deletes one word.\n\
\n\
  Shift  Extends the selection to the cursor position. If\n\
 	 there's no selection, begins one between the old\n\
 	 and new cursor positions.\n\
\n\
  Alt	 When modifying a selection, makes the selection\n\
 	 rectangular.\n\

heading in the Help menu.",

"Shifting and Filling\n\
\n\
\n\
Shift Left, Shift Right \n\
\n\
While shifting blocks of text is most important for programmers (See \
Features for Programming), it is also useful for other tasks, such as \
creating indented paragraphs.\n\
\n\
To shift a block of text one tab stop to the right, select the text, \
then choose Shift Right from the Edit menu.  Note that the accelerator \
keys for these menu items are Ctrl+9 and Ctrl+0, which correspond to \
the right and left parenthesis on most keyboards.  Remember them as \
adjusting the text in the direction pointed to by the parenthesis \
character.  Holding the Shift key while selecting either Shift Left or \
Shift Right will shift the text by one character.\n\
\n\
It is also possible to shift blocks of text by selecting the text \
rectangularly, and dragging it left or right (and up or down as well).  \
Using a rectangular selection also causes tabs within the selection to \
be recalculated and substituted, such that the non-whitespace characters \
remain stationary with respect to the selection.\n\
\n\
\n\
Filling \n\
\n\
Text filling using the Fill Paragraph command in the Edit menu is one \
of the most important concepts in NEdit.  And it will be well worth \
your while to understand how to use it properly.\n\
\n\
In plain text files, unlike word-processor files, there is no way to \
tell which lines are continuations of other lines, and which lines are \
meant to be separate, because there is no distinction in meaning \
between newline characters which separate lines in a paragraph, and \
ones which separate paragraphs from other text.  This makes it \
impossible for a text editor like NEdit to tell parts of the text \
which belong together as a paragraph from carefully arranged \
individual lines.\n\
\n\
In continuous wrap mode (Preferences -> Wrap -> Continuous), lines \
automatically wrap and unwrap themselves to line up properly at the \
right margin.  In this mode, you simply omit the newlines within \
paragraphs and let NEdit make the line breaks as needed.  Unfortunately, \
continuous wrap mode is not appropriate in the majority of situations, \
because files with extremely long lines are not common under Unix and \
may not be compatible with all tools, and because you can't achieve \
effects like indented sections, columns, or program comments, and still \
take advantage of the automatic wrapping.\n\
\n\
Without continuous wrapping, paragraph filling is not entirely \
automatic.  Auto-Newline wrapping keeps paragraphs lined up as you \
type, but once entered, NEdit can no longer distinguish newlines which \
join wrapped text, and newlines which must be preserved.  Therefore, \
editing in the middle of a paragraph will often leave the right margin \
messy and uneven.\n\
\n\
Since NEdit can't act automatically to keep your text lined up, you \
need to tell it explicitly where to operate, and that is what Fill \
Paragraph is for.  It arranges lines to fill the space between two \
margins, wrapping the lines neatly at word boundaries.  Normally, the \
left margin for filling is inferred from the text being filled.  The \
first line of each paragraph is considered special, and its left \
indentation is maintained separately from the remaining lines (for \
leading indents, bullet points, numbered paragraphs, etc.).  Otherwise, \
the left margin is determined by the furthest left non-whitespace \
character.  The right margin is either the Wrap Margin, set in the \
preferences menu (by default, the right edge of the window), or can \
also be chosen on the fly by using a rectangular selection (see below).\n\
\n\
There are three ways to use Fill Paragraph.  The simplest is, while you \
are typing text, and there is no selection, simply select Fill Paragraph \
(or type Ctrl+J), and NEdit will arrange the text in the paragraph \
adjacent to the cursor.  A paragraph, in this case, means an area of \
text delimited by blank lines.\n\
\n\
The second way to use Fill Paragraph is with a selection.  If you select \
a range of text and then chose Fill Paragraph, all of the text in the \
selection will be filled.  Again, continuous text between blank lines is \
interpreted as paragraphs and filled individually, respecting leading \
indents and blank lines.\n\
\n\
The third, and most versitile, way to use Fill Paragraph is with a \
rectangular selection.  Fill Paragraph treats rectangular selections \
differently from other commands.  Instead of simply filling the text \
inside the rectangular selection, NEdit interprets the right edge of \
the selection as the requested wrap margin.  Text to the left of the \
selection is not disturbed (the usual interpretation of a rectangular \
selection), but text to the right of the selection is included in the \
operation and is pulled in to the selected region.  This method enables you \
to fill text to an arbitrary right margin, without going back and forth \
to the wrap-margin dialog, as well as to exclude text to the left of \
the selection such as comment bars or other text columns.",

"Syntax Highlighting means using colors and fonts to help distinguish \
language elements in programming languages and other types of \
structured files.  Programmers use syntax highlighting to understand \
code faster and better, and to spot many kinds of syntax errors more \
quickly.\n\
\n\
To use syntax highlighting in NEdit, select Highlight Syntax in the \
Preferences menu.  If NEdit recognizes the computer language that you \
are using, and highlighting rules (patterns) are available for that \
language, it will highlight your text, and maintain the highlighting, \
automatically, as you type.\n\
\n\
If NEdit doesn't correctly recognize the type of the file you are \
editing, you can manually select a language mode from Language Modes in \
the Preferences menu.  You can also program the method that NEdit uses \
to recognize language modes in Preferences -> Default Settings -> \
Language Modes....\n\
\n\
If no highlighting patterns are available for the language that you \
want to use, you can create new patterns relatively quickly.  The \
Help section \"Highlighting Patterns\" under \"Customizing\", has details.\n\
\n\
If you are satisfied with what NEdit is highlighting, but would like it \
to use different colors or fonts, you can change these by selecting \
Preferences -> Default Settings -> Syntax Highlighting -> Text Drawing \
Styles.  Highlighting patterns are \
connected with font and color information through a common set of \
styles so that colorings defined for one language will be similar \
across others, and patterns within the same language which are meant to \
appear identical can be changed in the same place.  To understand which \
styles are used to highlight the language you are interested in, you \
may need to look at \"Patterns for Highlighting\" section, as well.\n\
\n\
Syntax highlighting is CPU intensive, and under some circumstances can \
affect NEdit's responsiveness.  If you have a particularly slow system, \
or work with very large files, you may not want to use it all of the \
time.  Syntax highlighting introduces two kinds of delays.  The first is \
an initial parsing delay, proportional to the size of the file.  This \
delay is also incurred when pasting large sections of text, filtering \
text through shell commands, and other circumstances involving changes \
to large amounts of text.  The second kind of delay happens when text which \
has not previously been visible is scrolled in to view.  Depending on \
your system, and the highlight patterns you are using, this may or may \
not be noticeable.  A typing delay is also possible, but unlikely if \
you are only using the built-in patterns.",

"If a system crash, network failure, X server crash, or program error should \
happen while you are editing a file, you can still recover most of your work.  \
NEdit maintains a backup file which it updates periodically (every 8 editing \
operations or 80 characters typed).  This file is has the same name as the \
file that you are editing, but with the character \"~\" (tilde) on Unix or \
\"_\" (underscore) on VMS prefixed \
to the name.  To recover a file after a crash, simply rename the file to \
remove the tilde or underscore character, replacing the older version of the \
file.  \
(Because several of the Unix shells consider the tilde to be a special \
character, you may have to prefix the character with a \"\\\" (backslash) \
when you move or delete an NEdit backup file.)\n\
\n\
Example, to recover the file called \"help.c\" on Unix type the command:\n\
\n\
    mv \\~help.c help.c\n\
\n\
On VMS, type:\n\
\n\
    RENAME _HELP.C HELP.C",

"The Preferences menu allows you to set options for both the current \
editing window, and default values for newly created windows and future \
NEdit sessions.  Options in the Preferences menu itself (not in the \
Default Settings sub-menu) \
take effect immediately and refer to the current window only.  Options \
in the Default Settings sub-menu have no effect on the current window, \
but instead provide initial settings for future windows created using \
the New or Open commands.  Preferences set in the Default Settings \
sub-menu can also be saved in a file \
that is automatically read by NEdit at startup time, by selecting \
Save Defaults.\n\
\n\
Preferences Menu\n\
\n\
    Default Settings -- Menu of initial settings for\n\
        future windows.  Generally the same as the\n\
        options in the main part of the menu, but apply\n\
        as defaults for future windows created during\n\
        this NEdit session.  These settings can be saved\n\
        using the Save Defaults command below, to be\n\
        loaded automatically each time NEdit is started.\n\
\n\
    Save Defaults -- Save the default options as set\n\
        under Default Settings for future NEdit sessions.\n\
\n\
    Statistics Line -- Show the full file name, line\n\
        number, and length of the file being edited.\n\
\n\
    Language Mode -- Tells NEdit what language (if any) to\n\
        assume, for selecting language-specific features\n\
	such as highlight patterns and smart indent macros,\n\
	and setting language specific preferences like word\n\
	delimiters, tab emulation, and auto-indent.  See\n\
	Features for Programming -> Programming With NEdit\n\
	for more information.\n\
\n\
    Auto Indent -- Setting Auto Indent \"on\" maintains a\n\
        running indent (pressing the return key will line\n\
	up the cursor with the indent level of the previous\n\
	line).  If smart indent macros are available for\n\
	the current language mode, smart indent can be\n\
	selected and NEdit will attempt to guess proper\n\
	language indentation for each new line.  See\n\
	Help -> Features for Programming -> Automatic\n\
	Indent for more information.\n\
\n\
    Wrap -- Choose between two styles of automatic wrapping\n\
        or none.  Auto Newline wrap, wraps text at word\n\
	boundaries when the cursor reaches the right margin,\n\
	by replacing the space or tab at the last word\n\
	boundary with a newline character.  Continuous Wrap\n\
	wraps long lines which extend past the right margin.\n\
	Continuous Wrap mode is typically used to produce\n\
	files where newlines are ommitted within paragraphs,\n\
	to make text filling automatic (a kind of poor-man's\n\
	word processor).  Text of this style is common on\n\
	Macs and PCs but is not necessarily supported very\n\
	well under Unix (except in programs which deal with\n\
	e-mail, for which it is often the format of choice).\n\
\n\
	Wrap Margin -- Set margin for Auto Newline Wrap,\n\
            Continuous Wrap, and Fill Paragraph.  Lines may,\n\
            be wrapped at the right margin of the window, or\n\
            the margin can be set at a specific column.\n\
\n\
    Tabs -- Set the tab distance (number of characters\n\
        between tab stops) for tab characters, and\n\
        control tab emulation and use of tab characters\n\
        in padding and emulated tabs.\n\
\n\
    Text Font... -- Change the font(s) used to display\n\
	text (fonts for menus and dialogs must be set\n\
	using X resources for the text area of the window).\n\
	See below for more information.\n\
\n\
    Highlight Syntax -- If NEdit recognizes the language\n\
        being edited, and highlighting patterns are\n\
	available for that language, use fonts and colors\n\
	to enhance viewing of the file.  (See Help ->\n\
	Features for Programming -> Syntax Highlighting\n\
	for more information.\n\
\n\
    Make Backup Copy -- On Save, write a backup copy of\n\
    	the file as it existed before the Save command\n\
    	with the extension .bck (Unix only).\n\
\n\
    Incremental Backup -- Periodically make a backup copy\n\
        of the file being edited under the name ~filename\n\
        on Unix or _filename on VMS (see Crash Recovery).\n\
\n\
    Show Matching (..) -- Momentarily highlight matching\n\
        parenthesis, brackets, and braces when one of\n\
        these characters is typed, or when the insertion\n\
        cursor is positioned after it.\n\
\n\
    Overtype -- In overtype mode, new characters entered\n\
        replace the characters in front of the insertion\n\
        cursor, rather than being inserted before them.\n\
\n\
    Read Only -- Lock the file against accidental\n\
        modification.  This temporarily prevents the\n\
        file from being modified in this NEdit session.\n\
        Note that this is diferent from setting the file\n\
        protection.\n\
\n\
Preferences -> Default Settings Menu\n\
\n\
Options in the Preferences -> Default Settings menu have the same \
meaning as those in the top-level Preferences menu, except that they \
apply to future NEdit windows and future NEdit sessions if saved \
with the Save Defaults command.  Additional options which appear in \
this menu are:\n\
\n\
    Language Modes -- Define language recognition\n\
        information (for determining language mode from\n\
	file name or content) and set language specific\n\
	preferences.\n\
\n\
    Customize Menus -- Add/remove items from the Shell,\n\
        Macro, and window background menus (see below).\n\
\n\
    Searching -- Options for controlling the behavior of\n\
        Find and Replace commands:\n\
\n\
	    Verbose - Presents search results in dialog\n\
	        form, asks before wrapping a search back\n\
		around the beginning (or end) of the file.\n\
\n\
	    Keep Dialogs Up - Don't pop down Replace and\n\
	        Find boxes after searching.\n\
\n\
	    Default Search Style - Initial setting for\n\
	        search type in Find and Replace dialogs.\n\
\n\
    Syntax Highlighting -- Program and configure enhanced\n\
        text display for new or supported languages (See\n\
	Features for Programming -> Syntax Highlighting).\n\
\n\
    Initial Window Size -- Default size for new windows.\n\
\n\
Changing Font(s)\n\
\n\
The font used to display text in NEdit is set under Preferences -> \
Text Font (for the current window), or Preferences -> Default Settings \
Text Font (for future windows).  These dialogs also allow you to set \
fonts for syntax highlighting.  If you don't intend to use syntax \
highlighting, you can ignore most of the dialog, and just set the \
field labeled Primary Font.\n\
\n\
Unless you are absolutely certain about the types of files that you \
will be editing with NEdit, you should choose a fixed-spacing font.  \
Many, if not most, plain-text files are written expecting to be viewed \
with fixed character spacing, and will look wrong with proportional spacing.  \
NEdit's filling, wrapping, and rectangular operations will also work strangely \
if you choose a proportional font.\n\
\n\
Note that in the font browser (the dialog \
brought up by the Browse... button), the subset of fonts which are shown is \
narrowed depending on the characteristics already selected.  It is \
therefore important to know that you can unselect characteristics \
from the lists by clicking on the selected items a second time.\n\
\n\
Fonts for syntax highlighting should ideally match the primary font \
in both height and spacing.  A mismatch in spacing will result in similar \
distortions as choosing a proportional font: column alignment will \
sometimes look wrong, and rectangular operations, wrapping, and filling \
will behave strangely.  A mismatch in height will cause windows to re-size \
themselves slightly when syntax highlighting is turned on or off, and \
increase the \
inter- line spacing of the text.  Unfortunately, on some systems it is \
hard to find sets of fonts which match exactly in height.\n\
\n\
Customizing Menus\n\
\n\
You can add or change items in the Shell, Macro, and window background \
menus under Preferences -> Default Settings -> Customize Menus.  When \
you choose one of these, you will see a dialog with a list of the \
current user-configurable items from the menu on the left.  \
To change an existing item, select it from the list, and its properties \
will appear in the remaining fields of the dialog, where you may change \
them.  Selecting the item \"New\" from the list allows you to enter new \
items in the menu.\n\
\n\
Hopefully most of the characteristics are self explanatory, but here are \
a few things to note:\n\
\n\
Accelerator keys are keyboard shortcuts which appear on the right hand \
side of the menus, and allow you avoid pulling down the menu and activate \
the command with a single keystroke.  Enter accelerators by typing the keys \
exactly as you would to activate the command.\n\
\n\
Mnemonics are a single letter which should be part of the menu item name, \
which allow users to traverse and activate menu items by typing keys when \
the menu is pulled down.\n\
\n\
In the Shell Command field of the Shell Commands dialog, the % character \
expands to the name (including directory path) of the file in the window.  \
To include a % character in the command, use %%.\n\
\n\
The Menu Entry field can contain special \
characters for constructing hierarchical sub-menus, and for making items \
which appear only in certain language modes.  The right angle bracket \
character \">\" creates a sub-menu.  The name of the item itself should \
be the last element of the path formed from successive sub-menu names \
joined with \">\".  Menu panes are called in to existence simply by \
naming them as part of a Menu Entry name.  To put several items in the same \
sub-menu, repeat the same hierarchical sequence for each.  For \
example, in the Macro Commands dialog, two items with menu entries: a>b>c and \
a>b>d would create a single sub menu under the macro menu called \"a\", \
which would contain a single sub-menu, b, holding the actual items, c and d:\n\
\n\
    +---++---++---+\n\
    |a >||b >||c  |\n\
    +---++---+|d  |\n\
    	      +---+\n\
\n\
To qualify a menu entry with a language mode, simply add an at-sign \"@\" \
at the end of the menu command, followed (no space) by a language mode \
name.  To make a menu item which appears in several language \
modes, append additional @s and language mode names.  For example, \
an item with the menu entry:\n\
\n\
  Make C Prototypes@C@C++\n\
\n\
would appear only in C and C++ language modes, and:\n\
\n\
  Make Class Template@C++\n\
\n\
would appear only in C++ mode.\n\
\n\
Menu items with no qualification appear in all language modes.\n\
\n\
\n\
Sharing Customizations with Other NEdit Users\n\
\n\
If you have written macro or shell menu commands, highlight patterns, \
or smart-indent macros that you want to share with other NEdit users, you \
can make a file which they can load into their nedit environment.\n\
\n\
To load such a file, start nedit with the command:\n\
\n\
   nedit -import <file>\n\
\n\
In the new nedit session, verify that the imported patterns or macros do \
what you want, then select Preferences -> Save Defaults.  \
Saving incorporates the changes into your own .nedit file, so the next \
time you run nedit, you will not have to import the distribution file.\n\
\n\
Loading a customization file is automated, but creating one is not.  \
To produce a file to be imported by other users, you must make a copy of \
your own .nedit file, and edit it, by hand, to remove everything but the \
few items of interest to the recipient.  Leave only the individual \
resource(s), and within those resources, only the particular macro, \
pattern, style, etc, that you wish to exchange.  For example, to share a \
highlighting pattern set, you would include the patterns, any new styles \
you added, and language mode information only if the patterns are \
intended to support a new language rather than updating an existing one. \
For example:\n\
\n\
   nedit.highlightPatterns:\\\n\
	My Language:1:0{\\n\\\n\
		Comment:\"#\":\"$\"::Comment::\\n\\\n\
		Loop Header:\"^[ \\\\t]*loop:\":::Loop::\\n\\\n\
	}\n\
   nedit.languageModes: My Language:.my::::::\n\
   nedit.styles: Loop:blue:Bold\n\
\n\
Resources are in the format of X resource files, but the format of text \
within multiple-item resources like highlight patterns, language modes, \
macros, styles, etc., are private to NEdit.  Each resource is a string \
which ends at the first newline character not escaped with \\, so you must \
be careful about how you treat ends of lines.  While you can generally \
just cut and paste indented sections, if something which was originally \
in the middle of a resource string is now at the end, you must remove the \
\\ line continuation character(s) so it will not join the next line into \
the resource.  Conversely, if something which was originally at the end \
of a resource is now in the middle, you'll have to add continuation \
character(s) to make sure that the resource string is properly continued \
from beginning to end, and possibly newline character(s) (\\n) to make \
sure that it is properly separated from the next item.",

"The Shell menu (Unix versions only) allows you to execute Unix shell commands \
from within NEdit.  You can add items to the menu to extend NEdit's command \
set or to incorporate custom automatic editing features using shell commands \
or editing languages like awk and \
sed.  To add items to the menu, select Preferences -> Default Settings \
Customize Menus -> Shell Menu.  NEdit comes pre-configured with \
a few useful Unix commands like spell and sort, but we encourage you to \
add your own custom extensions.\n\
\n\
Filter Selection... prompts you for a Unix command to \
use to process the currently selected text.  The output from this \
command replaces the contents of the selection.\n\
\n\
Execute Command... prompts you for a Unix command and replaces the \
current selection with the output of the command.  If there is no \
selection, it deposits the output at the current insertion point.\n\
\n\
Execute Command Line uses the position of the cursor in the window \
to indicate a line to execute as a shell command line.  The cursor may \
be positioned anywhere on the line.  This command allows you to use \
an NEdit window as an editable command window for saving output \
and saving commands for re-execution.\n\
\n\
The X resource called nedit.shell (See Customizing NEdit) determines \
which Unix shell is used to execute commands.  The default value for \
this resource is /bin/csh.",

"Regular expressions are available in the Find... and Replace... \
dialogs as a way to match inexact sequences of characters.  \
Regular expression substitution can also be used to program \
automatic editing operations.  For example, the following are \
search and replace strings to find occurrences of the \
subroutine get_x, reverse the first and second parameters, add a \
third parameter of NULL, and change the name to new_get_x\":\n\
\n\
	Search string:  get_x\\(([^ ,]*), ([^\\)]*)\\)\n\
	Replace string: new_get_x(\\2, \\1, NULL)\n\
\n\
To use regular expressions, click on the Regular Expression button \
in the Find... or Replace... dialogs before doing a search or \
replacement.\n\
\n\
Regular Expression Syntax\n\
\n\
The components of a regular expression are: branches, \
pieces, atoms, and ranges. A regular expression consists of zero or \
more branches, separated by `|'.  It matches anything that matches one \
of the branches.\n\
\n\
A branch is zero or more pieces, concatenated.  It matches a match for \
the first, followed by a match for the second, etc.\n\
\n\
A piece is an atom possibly followed by `*', `+', or `?'.  An atom \
followed by `*' matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom.  An \
atom followed by `+' matches a sequence of 1 or more matches of the \
atom.  An atom followed by `?' matches a match of the atom, or the null \
string.\n\
\n\
An atom is a regular expression in parentheses (matching a match for the \
regular expression), a range (see below), `.' (matching any single \
character), `^' (matching the null string at the beginning of a line \
string), `$' (matching the null string at the end of a line), `<' or `>' \
(matching the null string at a word boundary), \
a `\\' followed by a single character (matching that character), or a \
single character with no other significance (matching that character).  \
\\t, \\n, \\b, \\r, and \\f represent the characters tab newline, backspace, \
carriage return, and form feed.\n\
\n\
A range is a sequence of characters enclosed in `[]'.  It normally \
matches any single character from the sequence.  If the sequence begins \
with `^', it matches any single character not from the rest of the \
sequence.  If two characters in the sequence are separated by `-', this \
is shorthand for the full list of ASCII characters between them (e.g. \
`[0-9]' matches any decimal digit).  To include a literal `]' in the \
sequence, make it the first character (following a possible `^').  To \
include a literal `-', make it the first or last character.  A backslash \
`\\' followed by a single character includes that character, however \
backslashes are not necessary for most special characters, since inside \
a range, only the `]', `-', and '\\' characters are treated specially.\n\
\n\
Substitution\n\
\n\
Wherever the substitution string contains the character `&', NEdit will \
substitute the the entire string that was matched in the Find operation.  \
Up to nine sub-expressions of the match string can also be inserted into \
the replacement string, using `\\' followed by a digit. \\1 through \\9 \
represent the strings that matched parenthesized expressions within the \
regular expression, numbered left-to-right in order of their opening \
parentheses.  Preceding & or \\1-9 with \\U, \\u, \\L, or \\l adjusts the \
case \
of the inserted text.  \\u and \\l change only the first character, while \
\\U and \\L change the entire string to upper or lower case.  \\t, \\n, \
\\b, \\r, and \\f represent the characters tab newline, backspace, \
carriage return, and form feed in a substitution string represent the tab and \
newline characters as they do in match strings.\n\
\n\
Ambiguity\n\
\n\
If a regular expression could match two different parts of the text, \
it will match the one which begins earliest.  If both begin in \
the same place but match different lengths, or match the same length \
in different ways, life gets messier, as follows.\n\
\n\
In general, the possibilities in a list of branches are considered in \
left-to-right order, the possibilities for `*', `+', and `?' are \
considered longest-first, nested constructs are considered from the \
outermost in, and concatenated constructs are considered leftmost-first.  The \
match that will be chosen is the one that uses the earliest possibility \
in the first choice that has to be made.  If there is more than one \
choice, the next will be made in the same manner (earliest possibility) \
subject to the decision on the first choice.  And so forth.\n\
\n\
For example, `(ab|a)b*c' could match `abc' in one of two ways.  The \
first choice is between `ab' and `a'; since `ab' is earlier, and does \
lead to a successful overall match, it is chosen.  Since the `b' is \
already spoken for, the `b*' must match its last possibility-the empty \
string-since it must respect the earlier choice.\n\
\n\
In the particular case where no `|'s are present and there is only one \
`*', `+', or `?', the net effect is that the longest possible match will \
be chosen.  So `ab*', presented with `xabbbby', will match `abbbb'.  \
Note that if `ab*' is tried against `xabyabbbz', it will match `ab' just \
after `x', due to the begins-earliest rule.  (In effect, the decision on \
where to start the match is the first choice to be made, hence subsequent \
choices must respect it even if this leads them to less-preferred \
alternatives.)",

#endif /*VMS*/

"NEdit can be operated on its own, or as a two-part client/server \
application.  Client/server mode is useful for \
integrating NEdit with software \
development environments, mailers, and other programs; or just as a \
quick way to open files from the shell command line without starting \
a new NEdit session.\n\
\n\
To run NEdit in server mode, type:\n\
\n\
    nedit -server\n\
\n\
NEdit can also be started in server mode via the nc program when \
no servers are available.\n\
\n\
The nc (for NEdit Client) program, which is distributed along with nedit, sends \
commands to an nedit server to open files, select lines, or execute editor \
actions.  It accepts a limited set of the nedit command line options: -read, \
-create, -line (or +n), -do, and a list of file names.  Listing a file on the \
nc command line means, open it if it is not already open and bring the window \
to the front.  -read and -create affect only newly opened files, but -line and \
-do can also be used on files which are already open (See  \
\"NEdit Command Line\" for more information).\n\
\n\
In typical Unix style, arguments affect the files which follow them on the \
command line, for example:\n\
\n\
    incorrect:   nc file.c -line 25\n\
    correct:     nc -line 25 file.c\n\
\n\
-read, -create, and -line affect all of the files which follow them on \
the command line.  The -do macro is executed only once, on the next file on \
the line.  -do without a file following it on the command line, executes \
the macro on the first available window (presumably when you give a -do \
command without a corresponding file or window, you intend it to do something \
independent of the window in which it happens execute).\n\
\n\
nc also accepts one command line option of its own, -noask (or -ask), \
which instructs it whether to automatically start a server if one is not \
available.  This is also settable via the X resource, nc.autoStart \
(See X Resources).\n\
\n\
Sometimes it is useful to have more than one NEdit server running, for \
example to keep mail and programming work separate, or more importantly \
for working with tools like ClearCase which provide different views of \
the file system from different shells.  The option, -svrname, to both nedit \
and nc, allow you to start, and communicate with, separate named servers.  \
A named server responds only to requests with the corresponding -svrname \
argument.\n\
\n\
Communication between nc and nedit is through the X display.  So as long as X \
windows is set up and working properly, nc will will work \
properly as well.  nc uses the DISPLAY environment variable, the machine name \
and your user name to find the appropriate server, meaning, if you have several \
machines sharing a common file system, nc will not be able to find a server \
that is running on a machine with a different host name, even though it may be \
perfectly appropriate for editing a given file.\n\
\n\
The command which nc uses to start an nedit server is settable \
via the X resource nc.serverCommand, by default, \
\"nedit -server\".",

"NEdit can be customized many different ways.  The most important \
user-settable options are presented in the Preferences menu, including \
all options that users might need to change during an editing session.  \
Options set in the Default Settings sub-menu of the Preferences menu \
can be preserved between sessions by selecting Save Defaults, \
which writes a file called .nedit in the user's \
home directory.  See the section titled \"Preferences\" for more details.\n\
\n\
User defined commands can be added to NEdit's Shell, Macro, and window \
background menus.  Dialogs for creating items in these menus can be found \
under Customize Menus in the Default Settings sub menu of the Preferences \
menu.\n\
\n\
For users who depend on NEdit every day and want to tune \
every excruciating detail, there are also X resources for tuning a vast number \
of such details, down to the color of each individual button.  See \
the section \"X Resources\" for more information, as well as a list of \
selected resources.\n\
\n\
The most common reason customizing your X resources for NEdit, however, \
is key binding.  While limited key binding can be done through Preferences \
settings (Preferences -> Default Settings -> Customize Menus), you can really \
only add keys this way, and each key must have a corresponding menu item.  \
Any significant changes to key binding should be made via the Translations \
resource and menu \
accelerator resources.  The sections titled \"Key Binding\" and \
\"X Resources\" have more information.",

"NEdit has additional options to those provided in the Preferences menu \
which are set using X resources.  \
Like most other X programs, NEdit can be customized to vastly unnecessary \
proportions, from initial window positions down to the font and shadow \
colors of each individual button (A complete discussion of how to do \
this is left to books on the X Windows System).  Key binding (see \
\"Key Binding\" \
is one of the most useful of these resource settable options.\n\
\n\
X resources are usually specified in a file called .Xdefaults or \
.Xresources in your \
home directory (on VMS this is sys$login:decw$xdefaults.dat).  On some \
systems, this file is read and its information \
attached to the X server (your screen) when you start X.  On other \
systems, the .Xdefaults file is read each time you run an X program.  \
When X resource values are attached to the X server, changes to the \
resource file are not available to application programs until you either run \
the xrdb program with the appropriate file as input, or re-start \
the X server.\n\
\n\
The .nedit File\n\
\n\
The .nedit (saved preferences) file is in the same format as an X resource \
file, and its contents can be moved into your X resource file.  One reason \
for doing so would be to attach server specific preferences, such as \
a default font to a particular X server.  Another reason for moving \
preferences into the X resource file would be to keep preferences menu \
options and resource settable options together in one place. Though \
the files are the same format, additional resources should not be added \
to the .nedit file, they will not be read, and NEdit modifies this file \
by overwriting it completely.  Note also that the contents of the .nedit \
file take precedence over the values of X resources.  Using \
Save Defaults after moving the contents of your .nedit file to your \
.Xdefaults file will re-create the .nedit file, interfering with \
the options that you have moved.\n\
\n\
Selected X Resource Names\n\
\n\
The following are selected NEdit resource names and default values \
for NEdit options not settable via the Preferences menu (for preference \
resource names, see your .nedit file):\n\
\n\
    nedit.tagFile: (not defined) -- The name of a file\n\
        of the type produced by the Unix ctags command\n\
        which NEdit will load at startup time (see\n\
        Features for Programmers).  The tag file provides\n\
        a database from which NEdit can automatically\n\
        open files containing the definition of a\n\
        particular subroutine or data type.\n\
\n\
    nedit.shell: /bin/csh -- (Unix systems only) The Unix\n\
        shell (command interpreter) to use for executing\n\
        commands from the Shell menu\n\
\n\
    nedit.wordDelimiters: .,/\\\\`'!@#%^&*()-=+{}[]\":;<>?\n\
        -- The characters, in addition to blanks and tabs,\n\
        which mark the boundaries between words for the\n\
        move-by-word (Ctrl+Arrow) and select-word (double\n\
        click) commands.  Note that this default value may\n\
	be overridden by the setting in Preferences ->\n\
	Default Settings -> Language Modes....\n\
\n\
    nedit.remapDeleteKey: True -- Setting this resource\n\
        to False restores the original Motif binding of\n\
        the delete key to forward-delete.  This binding\n\
        causes problems when X servers with one delete/\n\
        backspace configuration are connected with X\n\
        clients of the other.  Users with a backspace\n\
        key in the backspace/delete position and who use\n\
        only machines with that style of keyboard can\n\
        set this resource to False to get back the\n\
        forward-delete function of the delete key.\n\
\n\
    nedit.stdOpenDialog: False -- Setting this resource\n\
        to True restores the standard Motif style of\n\
        Open dialog.  NEdit file open dialogs are missing\n\
        a text field at the bottom of the dialog, where\n\
        the file name can be entered as a string.  The\n\
        field is removed in NEdit to encourage users to\n\
        type file names in the list, a non-standard, but\n\
        much faster method for finding files.\n\
\n\
    nedit.bgMenuButton: ~Shift~Ctrl~Meta~Alt<Btn3Down> --\n\
        Specification for mouse button / key combination\n\
	to post the background menu (in the form of an X\n\
	translation table event specification).  The event\n\
	specification should be as specific as possible,\n\
	since it will override less specific translation\n\
    	table entries.\n\
\n\
    nedit.maxPrevOpenFiles: 30 -- Number of files listed\n\
        in the Open Previous sub-menu of the File menu.\n\
        Setting this to zero disables the Open Previous\n\
        menu item and maintenance of the .neditdb file.\n\
\n\
    nedit.printCommand: (system specific) -- Command used\n\
        by the print dialog to print a file, i.e. lp,\n\
        lpr, etc..  The command must be capable of\n\
        accepting input via stdin (standard input).\n\
\n\
    nedit.printCopiesOption: (system specific) -- Option\n\
        name used to specify multiple copies to the print\n\
        command.  If the option should be separated from\n\
        its argument by a space, leave a trailing space.\n\
        If blank, no \"Number of Copies\" item will\n\
        appear in the print dialog.\n\
\n\
    nedit.printQueueOption: (system specific) -- Option\n\
        name used to specify a print queue to the print\n\
        command.  If the option should be separated from\n\
        its argument by a space, leave a trailing space.\n\
        If blank, no \"Queue\" item will appear in the\n\
        print dialog.\n\
\n\
    nedit.printNameOption: (system specific) -- Option\n\
        name used to specify a job name to the print\n\
        command.  If the option should be separated from\n\
        its argument by a space, leave a trailing space.\n\
        If blank, no job or file name will be attached\n\
        to the print job or banner page.\n\
\n\
    nedit.printHostOption: (system specific) -- Option\n\
        name used to specify a host name to the print\n\
        command.  If the option should be separated from\n\
        its argument by a space, leave a trailing space.\n\
        If blank, no \"Host\" item will appear in the\n\
        print dialog.\n\
\n\
    nedit.printDefaultQueue: (system specific) -- The\n\
        name of the default print queue.  Used only to\n\
        display in the print dialog, and has no effect on\n\
        printing.\n\
\n\
    nedit.printDefaultHost: (system specific) -- The\n\
        node name of the default print host.  Used only\n\
        to display in the print dialog, and has no effect\n\
        on printing.\n\
\n\
    nedit.multiClickTime: (system specific) -- Maximum\n\
        time in milliseconds allowed between mouse clicks\n\
        within double and triple click actions.\n\
\n\
    nedit*scrollBarPlacement: BOTTOM_LEFT -- How scroll\n\
        bars are placed in NEdit windows, as well as\n\
        various lists and text fields in the program.\n\
        Other choices are: BOTTOM_RIGHT, TOP_LEFT, or\n\
        TOP_RIGHT.\n\
\n\
    nedit*text.autoWrapPastedText: False -- When Auto-\n\
        Newline Wrap is turned on, apply automatic\n\
	wrapping (which normally only applies to typed\n\
	text) to pasted text as well.\n\
\n\
    nedit*text.heavyCursor: False -- For monitors with\n\
        poor resolution or users who have difficulty\n\
        seeing the cursor, makes the cursor in the text\n\
        editing area of the window heavier and darker.\n\
\n\
    nedit*text.foreground: black -- Foreground color of\n\
        the text editing area of the NEdit window.\n\
\n\
    nedit*text.background: white -- Background color of\n\
        the text editing area of the NEdit window.\n\

"There are several ways to change key bindings in NEdit.  The easiest \
way to add a new key binding in NEdit is to define a macro in Preferences -> \
Default Settings -> Customize Menus -> Macro Menu.  \
However, if you want to change existing bindings or add a significant \
number of new key bindings you will need to do so via X resources.\n\
\n\
Before reading this section, \
you must understand how to set X resources (see the help section \"X \
Resources\").  Since setting X resources is tricky, it is also helpful \
when working on key-binding, to set some easier-to-verify resource at the \
same time, \
as a simple check that the NEdit program is actually seeing your changes.  \
The appres program is also very helpful in checking that the resource \
settings that you make, actually reach the program for which they are \
intended in the correct form.\n\
\n\
Key Binding in General\n\
\n\
Keyboard commands are associated with editor action routines through \
two separate mechanisms in NEdit.  Commands which appear in pull-down \
menus have individual resources designating a keyboard equivalent to \
the menu command, called an accelerator key.  Commands which do not have \
an associated menu item are bound to keys via the X toolkit translation \
mechanism.  The methods for changing these two kinds of bindings are \
quite different.\n\
\n\
Key Binding Via Translations\n\
\n\
The most general way to bind actions to keys in NEdit is to use the \
translation table associated with the text widget.  To add a binding to \
Alt+Y to insert the string \"Hi!\", for example, add lines similar to the \
following to your X resource file:\n\
\n\
  NEdit*text.Translations: #override \\n\\\n\
    Alt<Key>y: insert_string(\"Hi!\") \\n\n\
\n\
The Help topic \"Action \
Routines\" lists the actions available to be bound.\n\
\n\
Translation tables map key and mouse presses, \
window operations, and other kinds of events, to actions.   \
The syntax for translation tables is simplified here, and you.  \
may need to refer to a book on the X window system for more detailed \
information.\n\
\n\
Note that accelerator resources (discussed below) override \
translations, and that most Ctrl+letter and Alt+letter combinations are \
already bound to an accelerator key.  To use one of these combinations from \
a translation table, therefore, you must first un-bind the original menu \
accelerator.\n\
\n\
A resource for changing a translation table \
consists of a keyword; #override, #augment, or #replace; \
followed by lines (separated by newline characters) pairing events with \
actions.  Events begin with modifiers, like Ctrl, Shift, or Alt, \
followed by the event type in <>.  BtnDown, Btn1Down, Btn2Down, Btn1Up, \
Key, KeyUp are valid event types.  For key presses, the \
event type is followed by the name of the key.  You can specify a \
combination of events, such as a sequence of key presses, by separating \
them with commas.  The other half of the event/action pair is a set \
of actions.  These are separated from the event specification by a colon \
and from each other by spaces.  Actions \
are names followed by parentheses, optionally \
containing one or more parameters separated by comas.\n\
\n\
Changing Menu Accelerator Keys\n\
\n\
The menu shortcut keys shown at the right of NEdit menu items can also \
be changed via X resources.  Each menu item has two \
resources associated with it, accelerator, the \
event to trigger the menu item; and acceleratorText, the string \
shown in the menu.  \
The form of the accelerator resource is the same as events for translation \
table entries discussed above, though multiple keys and other subtleties \
are not allowed.  \
The resource name for a menu is the title in lower case, followed by \
\"Menu\", the resource name of menu item is the name in lower case, run \
together, with words separated by caps, and all punctuation removed.  \
For example, to change Cut to Ctrl+X, \
you would add the following to your .Xdefaults file:\n\
\n\
    nedit*editMenu.cut.accelerator: Ctrl<Key>x\n\
    nedit*editMenu.cut.acceleratorText: Ctrl+X\n\
\n\
Accelerator keys with optional shift key modifiers, like Find..., have an \
additional accelerator resource with Shift appended to the name.  For \
example:\n\
\n\
    nedit*searchMenu.find.acceleratorText: [Shift]Alt+F\n\
    nedit*searchMenu.find.accelerator: Alt<Key>f\n\
    nedit*searchMenu.findShift.accelerator: Shift Alt<Key>f",

"Learn/Replay\n\
\n\
Selecting Learn Keystrokes from the Macro menu puts NEdit in learn mode.  \
In learn mode, keystrokes and menu commands are recorded, to be played \
back later, using the Replay Keystrokes command, or pasted into a \
macro in the Macro Commands dialog of the Default Settings menu in \
Preferences.\n\
\n\
Note that only keyboard and menu commands are recorded, not mouse clicks \
or mouse movements since these have no absolute point of reference, such \
as cursor or selection position.  When you do a mouse-based operation in \
learn mode, NEdit will beep (repeatedly) to remind you that the operation \
was not recorded.\n\
\n\
Learn mode is also the quickest and easiest method for writing macros.  The \
dialog for creating macro commands contains a button labeled \"Paste Learn / \
Replay Macro\", which will deposit the last sequence learned into the body \
of the macro.\n\
\n\
Repeating Actions and Learn/Replay Sequences\n\
\n\
You can repeat the last (keyboard-based) command, or learn/replay sequence \
with the Repeat... command in the Macro menu.  To repeat an action, first \
do the action (i.e. insert a character, do a \
search, move the cursor), then select Repeat..., \
decide how or how many times you want it repeated, and click OK.  For \
example, to move down 30 lines through a file, you could type: <Down Arrow> \
Ctrl+, 29 <Return>.  To repeat a \
learn/replay sequence, first learn it, then select Repeat..., click on \
Learn/Replay and how you want it repeated, then click OK.\n\
\n\
If the commands \
you are repeating advance the cursor through the file, you can also repeat \
them within a range of characters, or \
from the current cursor position to the end of the file.  To iterate over \
a range of characters, use the primary \
selection (drag the left mouse button over the text) to mark the range \
you want to operate on, \
and select \"In Selection\" in the Repeat dialog.\n\
\n\
When using In \"Selection\" or \"To End\" with a learned sequence, try \
to do cursor movement as the last step in the sequence, since testing of \
the cursor position is only done at the end of the sequence execution.  \
If you do cursor movement first, for example searching for a particular \
word then doing a modification, the position of the cursor won't be \
checked until the sequence has potentially gone far beyond the end of \
your desired range.\n\
\n\
It's easy for a repeated command to get out of hand, and you can easily \
generate an infinite loop by using range iteration on a command which \
doesn't progress.  To cancel a repeating command in progress, type Ctrl+. \
(period), or select Cancel Macro from the Macro menu.",

"Macros can be called from Macro menu commands, window background menu \
commands, within the smart-indent \
framework, and from the .neditmacro file.  Macro menu and window \
background menu commands are defined under Preferences -> \
Default Settings -> Customize Menus.  Help on creating items in these menus \
can be found in the section, Help -> Customizing -> Preferences.  \
The .neditmacro file is a file of macro commands and definitions which you \
can create in your home directory, and \
which NEdit will automatically load when it is first started.\n\
\n\
NEdit's macro language is a simple interpreter with integer \
arithmetic, dynamic strings, and C-style looping constructs \
(very similar to the procedural portion of the Unix awk program).  \
From the macro language, you can call the same action routines \
which are bound to keyboard keys and menu items, as well \
additional subroutines for accessing and manipulating editor data, \
which are specific to the macro language (these are listed in the \
sections titled Macro Subroutines, and Actions).\n\
\n\
\n\
SYNTAX\n\
\n\
An NEdit macro language program consists of a list of statements, \
each terminated by a newline.  Groups of statements which are \
executed together conditionally, such as the body of a loop, are \
surrounded by curly braces \"{}\".\n\
\n\
Blank lines and comments are also allowed.  Comments begin with a \
\"#\" and end with a newline, and can appear either on a line by \
themselves, or at the end of a statement.\n\
\n\
Statements which are too long to fit on a single line may be \
split across several lines, by placing a backslash \"\\\" character \
at the end of each line to be continued.\n\
\n\
\n\
DATA TYPES\n\
\n\
The NEdit macro language recognizes only two data types, dynamic \
character strings, and integer values.  In general strings and \
integers can be used interchangeably.  If a string represents an \
integer value, it can be used as an integer.  Integers can be \
compared and concatenated with strings.\n\
\n\
Integer Constants\n\
\n\
Integers are non-fractional numbers in the range of -2147483647 to \
2147483647.  Integer constants must be in decimal.  For example:\n\
\n\
  a = -1\n\
  b = 1000\n\
\n\
Character String Constants\n\
\n\
Character string constants are enclosed in \
double quotes.  For example:\n\
\n\
   a = \"a string\"\n\
   dialog(\"Hi there!\", \"Dismiss\")\n\
\n\
Strings may also include C-language style escape sequences:\n\
\n\
   \\\\ Backslash      \\t Tab		  \\f Form feed\n\
   \\\" Double quote   \\b Backspace	  \\a Alert\n\
   \\n Newline	     \\r Carriage return   \\v Vertical tab\n\
\n\
For example, to send output to the terminal \
from which nedit was started, a newline character is neccessary \
because, like printf, t_print requires explicit newlines, and \
also buffers its output on a per-line basis:\n\
\n\
   t_print(\"a = \" a \"\\n\")\n\
\n\
\n\
VARIABLES\n\
\n\
Variable names must begin either with a letter (local variables), or \
a $ (global variables).  Beyond the first character, variables may \
also contain numbers and underscores `_'.  Variables are called in to \
existence just by setting them (no explicit declarations are necessary).\n\
\n\
Local variables are limited in scope to \
the subroutine (or menu item definition) in which they appear.  \
Global variables are accessible from all routines, and their values \
persist beyond the call which created them, until reset.\n\
\n\
Built-in Variables\n\
\n\
NEdit has a number of permanently defined variables, which are used \
to access global editor information and information about the the \
window in which the macro is executing.  These are listed along with \
the built in functions in the section titled Macro Subroutines.\n\
\n\
\n\
FUNCTIONS and SUBROUTINES\n\
\n\
The syntax of a function or subroutine call is:\n\
\n\
   function_name(arg1, arg2, ...)\n\
\n\
where arg1, arg2, etc. represent up to 9 argument values which are \
passed to the routine being called.  A function or subroutine call \
can be on a line by itself, as above, or if it \
returns a value, can be invoked within a character or numeric \
expression:\n\
\n\
   a = fn1(b, c) + fn2(d)\n\
   dialog(\"fn3 says: \" fn3())\n\
\n\
Arguments are passed by value.  This means that you can not return \
values via the argument list, only through the function value or \
indirectly through agreed-upon global variables.\n\
\n\
Built-in Functions\n\
\n\
NEdit has a wide range of built in functions which can be called from \
the macro language.  These routines are divided into two classes, \
macro-language functions, and editor action routines.  Editor action \
routines are more flexible, in that they may be called either from \
the macro language, or bound directly to keys via translation tables.  \
They are also limited, however, in that they can not return values.  \
Macro language routines can return values, but can not be bound to \
keys in translation tables.\n\
\n\
Nearly all of the built-in subroutines operate on an implied window, \
which is initially the window from which the macro was started.  To \
manipulate the contents of other windows, use the focus_window \
subroutine to change the focus to the ones you wish to modify.  \
focus_window can also be used to iterate over all of the currently open \
windows, using the special keyword names, \"last\" and \"next\".\n\
\n\
For backwards compatibility, hyphenated action routine names are \
allowed, and most of the existing action routines names which contain \
underscores have an equivalent version containing hyphens ('-') \
instead of underscores.  Use of these names is discouraged.  The macro \
parser resolves the ambiguity between '-' as the subtraction/negation \
operator, and - as part of an action routine name by assuming \
subtraction unless the symbol specifically matches an action routine \
name.\n\
\n\
User Defined Functions\n\
\n\
Users can define their own macro subroutines, using the define \
keyword:\n\
\n\
   define subroutine_name {\n\
      < body of subroutine >\n\
   }\n\
\n\
Macro definitions can not appear within other definitions, or within macro \
menu item definitions (usually they are found in the .neditmacro file).\n\
\n\
The arguments with which a user-defined subroutine or function was \
invoked, are presented as $1, $2, ... , $9.  The number of arguments \
can be read from $n_args.\n\
\n\
\n\
OPERATORS AND EXPRESSIONS\n\
\n\
Operators have the same meaning and precedence that they do in C, \
except for ^, which raises a number to a power (y^x means y to the x \
power), rather than bitwise exclusive OR.  The table below lists \
operators in decreasing order of precedence.\n\
\n\
   Operators		    Associativity\n\
   ()\n\
   ^			    right to left\n\
   - ! ++ --		    (unary)\n\
   * / %		    left to right\n\
   + -  		    left to right\n\
   > >= < <= == !=	    left to right\n\
   &			    left to right\n\
   |			    left to right\n\
   &&			    left to right\n\
   ||			    left to right\n\
   (concatenation)	    left to right\n\
   = += -= *= /= %=, &= |=  right to left\n\
\n\
The order in which operands are evaluated in an expression is \
undefined, except for && and ||, which like C, evaluate operands left \
to right, but stop when further evaluation would no longer change the \
result.\n\
\n\
Numerical Operators\n\
\n\
The numeric operators supported by the NEdit macro language are listed \
below:\n\
\n\
   + addition\n\
   - subtraction or negation\n\
   * multiplication\n\
   / division\n\
   % modulo\n\
   ^ power\n\
   & bitwise and\n\
   | bitwise or\n\
\n\
Increment (++) and decrement (--) operators can also be appended or \
prepended to variables within an expression.  Prepended increment/decrement \
operators act before the variable is evaulated.  Appended increment/decrement \
operators act after the variable is evaluated.\n\
\n\
Logical and Comparison Operators\n\
\n\
Logical operations produce a result of 0 (for false) or 1 (for true).  \
In a logical operation, any non-zero value is recognized to mean true.  \
The logical and comparison operators allowed in the NEdit macro \
language are listed below:\n\
\n\
   && logical and\n\
   || logical or\n\
   !  not\n\
   >  greater\n\
   <  less\n\
   >= greater or equal\n\
   <= less or equal\n\
   == equal (integers and/or strings)\n\
   != not equal (integers and/or strings)\n\
\n\
Character String Operators\n\
\n\
The \"operator\" for concatenating two strings is the absence of an \
operator.  Adjoining character strings with no operator in between \
means concatenation:\n\
\n\
   d = a b \"string\" c\n\
   t_print(\"the value of a is: \" a)\n\
\n\
Comparison between character strings is done with the == and != \
operators, (as with integers).  There are a number of useful \
built-in routines for working with character strings, which are \
listed in the section called Macro Subroutines.\n\
\n\
\n\
LOOPING AND CONDITIONALS\n\
\n\
NEdit supports looping constructs: for and while, and conditional \
statements: if and else, with essentially the same syntax as C:\n\
\n\
   for (<init>, ...; <condition>; <increment>, ...) <body>\n\
\n\
   while (<condition>) <body>\n\
\n\
   if (<condition>) <body>\n\
\n\
   if (<condition>) <body> else <body>\n\
\n\
<body>, as in C, can be a single statement, or a list of statements \
enclosed in curly braces ({}).  <condition> is an expression which \
must evaluate to true for the statements in <body> to be executed.  \
for loops may also contain initialization statements, <init>, \
executed once at the beginning of the loop, and increment/decrement \
statements (or any arbitrary statement), which are executed at the end \
of the loop, before the condition is evaluated again.\n\
\n\
Examples:\n\
\n\
  for (i=0; i<100; i++)\n\
     j = i * 2\n\
\n\
  for (i=0, j=20; i<20; i++, j--) {\n\
     k = i * j\n\
     t_print(i, j, k)\n\
  }\n\
\n\
  while (k > 0)\n\
  {\n\
     k = k - 1\n\
     t_print(k)\n\
  }\n\
\n\
  for (;;) {\n\
     if (i-- < 1)\n\
         break\n\
  }\n\
\n\
Loops may contain break and continue statements.  A break statement \
causes an exit from the innermost loop, a continue statement transfers \
control to the end of the loop.",

with punctuation removed, all lower case, and underscores \
replacing spaces.  Without the \
_dialog suffix, commands which normally prompt the user for information, \
instead take the information from the routine's arguments (see below).  To \
present a dialog and ask the user for input, rather than supplying it in via \
arguments, use the actions with the _dialog suffix.\n\

previous versions, but if you actually use this capability, please send us some \
mail, otherwise it is likely to disappear in the future.\n\
\n\
move_to()\n\
If a secondary selection exists, deletes the contents of the secondary \
selection and inserts it at the cursor, or if pending-delete is on and there is \
a primary selection, replaces the primary selection.  If no secondary selection \
exists, moves the primary selection to the pointer location, deleting it \
from its original position.\n\
\n\

Completes either a secondary selection operation, or a primary \
drag.  If the user is dragging the mouse to adjust a secondary selection, \
the selection is deleted and either inserted at the cursor location, \
or, if pending-delete is on and a primary selection exists in the window, \
replaces the primary selection.  If the user is dragging a block of \
text (primary selection), completes the drag operation and deletes the \
text from it's current location.\n\

reposition the primary text being dragged.  Takes two optional arguments, \
\"copy\", and \"overlay\".  \"copy\" leaves a copy of the dragged text \
at the site at which the drag began.  \"overlay\" does the drag in overlay \
mode, meaning the dragged text is laid on top of the existing text, \
obscuring and ultimately deleting it when the drag is complete.\n\
\n\

of the key pressed.\n\
\n\
Arguments to Keyboard Action Routines \n\
\n\
In addition to the arguments listed in the call descriptions, any routine \
involving cursor movement can take the argument \"extend\", meaning, adjust \

the \"extend\" argument as well as mouse dragging operations for both \
primary and secondary selections can take the optional keyword \"rect\", \
meaning, make the selection rectangular.",

"WRITING SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING PATTERNS\n\
\n\
Patterns are the mechanism by which syntax highlighting (see Syntax \
Highlighting under the heading of Features for Programming) \
is programmed in NEdit, that is, how it decides what to highlight in a given \
language.  \
To create syntax highlighting patterns for a new language, or to \
modify existing patterns, select \"Patterns for Highlighting\" from \
\"Syntax Highlighting\" sub-section of the \"Default Settings\" sub-menu \
of the \"Preferences\" menu.\n\
\n\
First, a word of caution.  As with regular expression matching in \
general, it is quite possible to write patterns which are so \
inefficient that they essentially lock up the editor as they \
recursively re-examine the entire contents of the file thousands of \
times.  With the multiplicity of patterns, the possibility of a lock-up \
is significantly increased in syntax highlighting.  When working \
on highlighting patterns, be sure to save your work frequently.\n\
\n\
NEdit's syntax highlighting is unusual in that it works in real-time \
(as you type), and yet is completely programmable using standard \
regular expression notation.  Other syntax highlighting editors usually fall \
either into the category of fully programmable but unable to keep up in \
real-time, or real-time but limited programmability.  The additional \
burden that NEdit places on pattern writers in order to achieve this \
speed/flexibility mix, is to force them to state self-imposed \
limitations on the amount of context that patterns may examine when \
re-parsing after a change.  While the \"Pattern Context Requirements\" \
heading is near the end of this section, it is not optional, and must be \
understood before making any any serious effort at pattern writing.\n\
\n\
In its simplest form, a highlight pattern consists of a regular \
expression to match, along with a style representing the font an color \
for displaying any text which matches that expression.  To bold the \
word, \"highlight\", wherever it appears the text, the regular expression \
simply would be the word \"highlight\".  The style (selected from the menu \
under the heading of \"Highlight Style\") determines how the text will be \
drawn.  To bold the text, either select an existing style, such as \
\"Keyword\", which bolds text, or create a new style and select it \
under Highlight Style.\n\
\n\
The full range of regular expression capabilities can be applied in \
such a pattern, with the single caveat that the expression must \
conclusively match or not match, within the pre-defined context \
distance (as discussed below under Pattern Context Requirements).\n\
\n\
To match longer ranges of text, particularly any constructs which \
exceed the requested context, you must use a pattern which highlights \
text between a starting and ending regular expression match.  To do so, \
select \"Highlight text between starting and ending REs\" under \
\"Matching\", and enter both a starting and ending regular expression.  \
For example, to highlight everything between double quotes, you would \
enter a double quote character in both the starting and ending regular \
expression fields.  Patterns with both a beginning and ending expression span \
all characters between the two expressions, including newlines.\n\
\n\
Again, the limitation for automatic parsing to operate properly is that \
both expressions must match within the context distance stated for the \
pattern set.\n\
\n\
With the ability to span large distances, comes the responsibility to \
recover when things go wrong.  Remember that syntax highlighting is \
called upon to parse incorrect or incomplete syntax as often as correct \
syntax.  To stop a pattern short of matching its end expression, you can \
specify an error expression, which stops the pattern from gobbling up \
more than it should.  For example, if the text between double quotes \
shouldn't contain newlines, the error expression might be \"$\".  As with \
both starting and ending expressions, error expressions must also match \
within the requested context distance.\n\
\n\
Coloring Sub-Expressions\n\
\n\
It is also possible to color areas of text within a regular \
expression match.  A pattern of this type associates a style with \
sub-expressions references of the parent pattern (as used in regular \
expression substitution patterns, see the NEdit Help menu item on \
Regular Expressions).  Sub-expressions of both the starting and ending \
patterns may be colored.  For example, if the parent pattern has a \
starting expression \"\\<\", and end expression \"\\>\", (for highlighting \
all of the text contained within angle brackets), a sub-pattern using \
\"\\0\" in both the starting and ending expression fields could color the \
brackets differently from the intervening text.  A quick shortcut to \
typing in pattern names in the Parent Pattern field is to use the \
middle mouse button to drag them from the Patterns list.\n\
\n\
Hierarchical Patterns\n\
\n\
A hierarchical sub-pattern, is identical to a top level pattern, but is \
invoked only between the beginning and ending expression matches of its \
parent pattern.  Like the sub-expression coloring patterns discussed \
above, it is associated with a parent pattern using the Parent Pattern \
field in the pattern specification.  Pattern names can be dragged from \
the pattern list with the middle mouse button to the Parent Pattern \
field.\n\
\n\
After the start expression of the parent pattern matches, the syntax \
highlighting parser searches for either the parent's end pattern or a \
matching sub-pattern.  When a sub-pattern matches, control is not \
returned to the parent pattern until the entire sub-pattern has been \
parsed, regardless of whether the parent's end pattern appears in the \
text matched by the sub-pattern.\n\
\n\
The most common use for this capability is for coloring sub-structure \
of language constructs (smaller patterns embedded in larger patterns).  \
Hierarchical patterns can also simplify parsing by having sub-patterns \
\"hide\" special syntax from parent patterns, such as special escape \
sequences or internal comments.\n\
\n\
There is no depth limit in nesting hierarchical sub-patterns, but \
beyond the third level of nesting, automatic re-parsing will sometimes \
have to re-parse more than the requested context distance to guaranty \
a correct parse (which can slow down the maximum rate at which the user \
can type if large sections of text are matched only by deeply nested \
patterns).\n\
\n\
While this is obviously not a complete hierarchical language parser it \
is still useful in many text coloring situations.  As a pattern writer, \
your goal is not to completely cover the language syntax, but to \
generate colorings that are useful to the programmer.  Simpler patterns \
are usually more efficient and also more robust when applied to \
incorrect code.\n\
\n\
Deferred (Pass-2) Parsing\n\
\n\
NEdit does pattern matching for syntax highlighting in two passes.  The \
first pass is applied to the entire file when syntax highlighting is \
first turned on, and to new ranges of text when they are initially read \
or pasted in.  The second pass is applied only as needed when text is \
exposed (scrolled in to view).\n\
\n\
If you have a particularly complex set of patterns, and parsing is \
beginning to add a noticeable delay to opening files or operations \
which change large regions of text, you can defer some of that parsing \
from startup time, to when it is actually needed for viewing the text.  \
Deferred parsing can only be used with single expression patterns, or \
begin/end patterns which match entirely within the requested context \
distance.  To defer the parsing of a pattern to when \
the text is exposed, click on the Pass-2 pattern type button in the \
highlight patterns dialog.\n\
\n\
Sometimes a pattern can't be deferred, not because of context \
requirements, but because it must run concurrently with pass-1 \
(non-deferred) patterns.  If they didn't run concurrently, a pass-1 \
pattern might incorrectly match some of the characters which would \
normally be hidden inside of a sequence matched by the deferred \
pattern.  For example, C has character constants enclosed in single \
quotes.  These typically do not cross line boundaries, meaning they can \
be parsed entirely within the context distance of the C pattern set and \
should be good candidates for deferred parsing.  However, they can't be \
deferred because they can contain sequences of characters which can \
trigger pass-one patterns. Specifically, the sequence, '\\\"', contains \
a double quote character, which would be matched by the string pattern \
and interpreted as introducing a string.\n\
\n\
Pattern Context Requirements\n\
\n\
The context requirements of a pattern set state how much additional \
text around any change must be examined to guaranty that \
the patterns will match what they are intended to match.  Context \
requirements are a promise by NEdit to the pattern writer, that the \
regular expressions in his/her patterns will be matched against at \
least <line context> lines and <character context> characters, around \
any modified text.  Combining line and character requirements guaranty \
that both will be met.\n\
\n\
Automatic re-parsing happens on EVERY KEYSTROKE, so the amount of \
context which must be examined is very critical to typing efficiency.  \
The more complicated your patterns, the more critical the context \
becomes.  To cover all of the keywords in a typical language, without \
affecting the maximum rate at which users can enter text, you may be \
limited to just a few lines and/or a few hundred characters of context.\n\
\n\
The default context distance is 1 line, with no minimum character \
requirement.  There are several benefits to sticking with this \
default.  One is simply that it is easy to understand and to comply \
with.  Regular expression notation is designed around single line \
matching.  To span lines in a regular expression, you must explicitly \
mention the newline character \"\\n\", and matches which are restricted to \
a single line are virtually immune to lock-ups.  Also, if you can code \
your patterns to work within a single line of context, without an \
additional character-range context requirement, the parser can take \
advantage the fact that patterns don't cross line boundaries, and \
nearly double its efficiency over a one-line and 1-character context \
requirement.  (In a single line context, you are allowed to match \
newlines, but only as the first and/or last character.)",

"Smart indent macros can be written for any language, but are usually \
more difficult to write than highlighting patterns.  A good place to start, \
of course, is to look at the existing macros for C and C++.\n\
\n\
Smart indent macros for a language mode consist of standard NEdit macro \
language code attached to any or all of the following three activation \
conditions: \
1) When smart indent is first turned on for a text window containing code \
of the language, 2) When a newline is typed and smart indent is expected, 3) \
after any character is typed.  To attach macro code to any of these code \
\"hooks\", enter it in the appropriate section in the Preferences -> \
Default Settings -> Auto Indent -> Program Smart Indent dialog.\n\
\n\
Typically most of the code should go in the initialization section, because \
that is the appropriate place for subroutine definitions, and smart indent \
macros are complicated enough that you are not likely to want to write them \
as one monolithic run of code.  You may also put code in the Common/Shared \
Initialization section (accessible through the button in the upper left \
corner of the dialog).  Unfortunately, since the C/C++ macros also reside \
in the common/shared section, when you add code there, you run some risk of \
missing out on future \
upgrades to these macros, because your changes will override the built-in \
defaults.\n\
\n\
The newline macro is invoked after the user types a newline, but before the \
newline is entered in the buffer.  It takes a single argument ($1) which is \
the position at which the newline will be inserted.  It must return the \
number of characters of indentation the line should have, or -1.  A \
return value of -1 means to do a standard auto-indent.  You must supply \
a newline macro, but the code: \"return -1\" (auto-indent), or \"return 0\" \
(no indent) is sufficient.\n\
\n\
The type-in macro takes two arguments.  $1 is the insert position, and $2 is \
the character just inserted, and does not return a value.  You can do just \
about anything here, but keep in mind that this macro is executed for every \
keystroke typed, so if you try to get too fancy, you may degrade performance.",

"SOLUTIONS TO COMMON PROBLEMS\n\
\n\
P: No files are shown in the \"Files\" list in the Open... dialog.\n\
S: When you use the \"Filter\" field, include the file specification or a \
complete directory specification, including the trailing \"/\" on Unix.  \
(See Help in the Open... dialog).\n\
\n\
P: Keyboard shortcuts for menu items don't work.\n\
S: Be sure the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys are both unlocked.  In Motif \
programs, these keys prevent the menu accelerators from working.\n\
\n\
P: Find Again and Replace Again don't continue in the same direction \
as the original Find or Replace.\n\
S: Find Again and Replace Again don't use the direction of the original \
search.  The Shift key controls the direction: Ctrl+G means \
forward, Shift+Ctrl+G means backward.\n\
\n\
P: Preferences specified in the Preferences menu don't seem to get saved \
when I select Save Defaults.\n\
S: NEdit has two kinds of preferences: 1) per-window preferences, in the \
Preferences menu, and 2) default settings for preferences in newly created \
windows, in the Default \
Settings sub-menu of the Preferences menu.  Per-window preferences are not \
saved by Save Defaults, only Default Settings.\n\
\n\
P: Columns and indentation don't line up.\n\
S: NEdit is using a proportional width font.  Set the font to a fixed style \
(see Preferences).\n\
\n\
P: NEdit performs poorly on very large files.\n\
S: Turn off Incremental Backup.  With Incremental Backup on, NEdit \
periodically writes a full copy of the file to disk.\n\
\n\
P: Commands added to the Shell Commands menu (Unix only) don't output \
anything until they are finished executing.\n\
S: If the command output is \
directed to a dialog, or the input is from a selection, output is collected \
together and held until the command completes.  De-select both of the options \
and the output will be shown incrementally as the command executes.\n\
\n\
P: Dialogs don't automatically get keyboard focus when they pop up.\n\
S: Most X Window managers allow you to choose between two categories of \
keyboard focus models: pointer focus, and explicit focus.  \
Pointer focus means that as you move the mouse around the screen, the window \
under the mouse automatically gets the keyboard focus.  NEdit users who use \
this focus model should set \"Popups Under Pointer\" in the Default Settings \
sub menu of the preferences menu in NEdit.  Users with the explicit \
focus model, in some cases, may have problems with certain dialogs, such as \
Find and Replace.  In MWM this is caused by the mwm resource startupKeyFocus \
being set to False (generally a bad choice for explicit focus users).  \
NCDwm users should use the focus model \"click\" \
instead of \"explicit\", again, unless you have set it that way to correct \
specific problems, this is the appropriate setting for most \
explicit focus users.\n\
\n\
P: The Delete key doesn't forward-delete.\n\
S: See the X Resources section on nedit.remapDeleteKey.\n\
\n\
P: NEdit crashes when I try to paste text in to a text field in a dialog \
(like Find or Replace) on my SunOS system.\n\
S: On many SunOS systems, you have to set up an nls directory before \
various inter-client communication features of Motif will function \
properly.  There are instructions in README.sun in /pub/nedit/v4_0_1 on \
ftp.fnal.gov, as well as a tar file containg a complete nls \
directory: ftp://ftp.fnal.gov/pub/nedit/v4_0_2/individual/README.sun. \
This contains directions for setting up an nls directory, which is \
required by Motif for handling copy and paste to Motif text fields. \
\n\
\n\
KNOWN BUGS\n\
\n\
Below is the list of known bugs which affect NEdit.  The bugs your copy \
of NEdit will exhibit depend on which system you are running and with which \
Motif libraries it was built. Note that there are now Motif 1.2 and/or 2.0 \
libraries available on ALL supported platforms, and as you can see below \
there are far fewer bugs in Motif 1.2, so it is in your best interest to \
upgrade your system.\n\
\n\
All Versions\n\
\n\
BUG: Operations between rectangular selections on overlapping lines \
do nothing.\n\
WORKAROUND: None.  These operations are \
very complicated and rarely used.\n\
\n\
BUG: Cut and Paste menu items fail, or possibly crash, for very large \
(multi-megabyte) selections.\n\
WORKAROUND: Use selection copy (middle mouse button click) for transferring \
larger quantities of data.  Cut and Paste save the copied text in server \
memory, which is usually limited.\n\
\n\
Motif 1.1 Versions\n\
\n\
BUG: The shortcut method for entering control characters (Alt+Ctrl+char) is \
not available.\n\
WORKAROUND: Use the Ins. Control Char command.\n\
\n\
BUG: Pop-up dialogs \"jump\" (appear briefly in a different location) when \
they are first invoked.\n\
WORKAROUND: Turn off \"Popups Under Pointer\" if this gives you a headache.\n\
\n\
IBM Versions built with Motif 1.1\n\
\n\
BUG: The Command to set the font for the current window is not \
available.\n\
WORKAROUND: Use the Default Settings sub-menu to set the default \
font and then create a new window.\n\
\n\
BUG: NEdit can occasionally crash on window closing.\n\
WORKAROUND: Save files frequently, see Crash Recovery.\n\
\n\
VMS Versions\n\
\n\
BUGS: 1. Abbreviation of command line qualifiers is not allowed.  2. \
Error messages for mistakes on the command line don't make sense.\n\
WORKAROUND: NEdit does not parse its command line with the standard DCL \
command parser, instead, it superficially converts the command line to \
a Unix-style command line before processing it.  Because information \
is lost, NEdit may not always be able to \
distinguish between items that are supposed to be qualifiers and those \
which are supposed to be files and arguments to the qualifiers.  \
However, correct VMS command lines are always processed correctly, and only \
certain types of errors will appear to give strange results.\n\
\n\
BUG: Protection settings for new versions of files produced by NEdit over \
DECNET connections may revert to defaults.\n\
WORKAROUND: Check and reset protections when accessing files via DECNET.\n\

End of INFORMATION/LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR NEDIT.",

"The Tabs dialog controls both the operation of the Tab \
key, and the interpretation of tab characters \
within a file.\n\
\n\
The first field, Tab Spacing, controls how  NEdit \
responds to tab characters in a file.  On most Unix and \
VMS systems the conventional interpretation of a tab \
character is to advance the text position to the nearest \
multiple of eight characters (a tab spacing of 8).  \
However, many programmers of C and other structured \
languages, when given the choice, prefer a tab spacing \
of 3 or 4 characters.  Setting a three or four character \
hardware tab spacing is useful and convenient as long as \
your other software tools support it.  Unfortunately, on \
Unix and VMS systems, system utilities, such as more, \
and printing software can't always properly display \
files with other than eight character tabs.\n\
\n\
Selecting \"Emulate Tabs\" will cause the Tab key to \
insert the correct number of spaces or tabs to reach the \
next tab stop, as if the tab spacing were set at the \
value in the \"Emulated tab spacing\" field.  \
Backspacing immediately after entering an emulated tab \
will delete it as a unit, but as soon as you move the \
cursor away from the spot, NEdit will forget that the \
collection of spaces and tabs is a tab, and will treat \
it as separate characters.  To enter a real tab \
character with \"Emulate Tabs\" turned on, use Ctrl+Tab.\n\
\n\
In generating emulated tabs, and in Shift Left, Paste \
Column, and some rectangular selection operations, NEdit \
inserts blank characters (spaces or tabs) to preserve \
the alignment of non-blank characters.  The bottom \
toggle button in the Tabs dialog instructs NEdit whether \
to insert tab characters as padding in such situations.  \
Turning this off, will keep NEdit from automatically \
inserting tabs.  Some software developers prefer to keep \
their source code free of tabs to avoid its \
misinterpretation on systems with different tab \
character conventions."
