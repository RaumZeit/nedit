/*
 * About the different #defines that Motif gives us:
 * All Motifs #define several values.  These are the values in
 * Open Motif 2.1.30, for example:
 *     #define XmVERSION       2
 *     #define XmREVISION      1
 *     #define XmUPDATE_LEVEL  30
 *     #define XmVersion       (XmVERSION * 1000 + XmREVISION)
 *     #define XmVERSION_STRING "@(#)Motif Version 2.1.30"
 * 
 * In addition, LessTif #defines several values as shown here for
 * version 0.93.0:
 *     #define LESSTIF_VERSION  0
 *     #define LESSTIF_REVISION 93
 *     #define LesstifVersion   (LESSTIF_VERSION * 1000 + LESSTIF_REVISION)
 *     #define LesstifVERSION_STRING \
 *             "@(#)GNU/LessTif Version 2.1 Release 0.93.0"
 *
 * Also, in LessTif the XmVERSION_STRING is identical to the 
 * LesstifVERSION_STRING.  Unfortunately, the only way to find out the
 * "update level" of a LessTif release is to parse the LesstifVERSION_STRING.
 *
 * To test:
        gcc -I /usr/X11R6/include/ -o check_tif check_tif.c
        gcc -I /usr/X11R6/LessTif/Motif2.1/include/ -o check_tif check_tif.c
        gcc -I /usr/X11R6/LessTif/Motif1.2/include/ -o check_tif check_tif.c
