# For editres, add -DEDITRES to CFLAGS and -lXmu to LIBS
# For systems older than IRIX 6.0, add -DUSE_MOTIF_GLOB to CFLAGS
#
# The flag NO_XMIM means that nedit will be using Motif composed-character
# input routines in Motif text fields, and the basic X ones in the nedit
# text widget.  This is not optimal because it leaves more room for user
# configuration problems.  It's set this way because of a bug in the IRIX
# 6.5 Motif XMIM routines which causes a crash on window closing.  As far
# as I know, other versions of IRIX are ok, and this can safely be removed.
#
# To evaluate an alternative layout for the Replace/Find dialog, add
# -DREPLACE_SCOPE to the CFLAGS. See the README file for more information.
#
# To test if the Motif library exports the runtime version
# add -DHAVE__XMVERSIONSTRING to CFLAGS
#
CFLAGS=-O -DSGI -DNO_XMIM

# For systems older than IRIX 6.0, add: BIGGER_STRINGS= -Wf,-XNl10000
