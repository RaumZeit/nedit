# The flag NO_XMIM means that nedit will be using Motif composed-character
# input routines in Motif text fields, and the basic X ones in the nedit
# text widget.  This is not optimal because it leaves more room for user
# configuration problems.  It's set this way because of a bug in the IRIX
# 6.5 Motif XMIM routines which causes a crash on window closing.  As far
# as I know, other versions of IRIX are ok, and this can safely be removed.
